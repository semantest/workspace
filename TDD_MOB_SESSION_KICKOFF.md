# 🎯 TDD MOB SESSION STARTING NOW!

## Time: 8:37 PM - Historic Team Moment!

### Session Details:
- **Feature**: image-download-queue
- **Mode**: Randori (rotating TDD phases)
- **Rotation**: Every 5 minutes sharp
- **Participants**: Development team

### The Sacred TDD Flow:
1. 🧪 **RED**: Current driver writes failing test
2. 🍬 **GREEN**: Next driver makes it pass (simplest way)
3. 🚀 **REFACTOR**: Following driver improves code
4. 🔄 **ROTATE**: Continue the cycle

### Session Rules:
✅ **Test First** - No production code without failing test
✅ **Small Steps** - Tiny increments, frequent commits
✅ **Verbalize** - Think out loud, share reasoning
✅ **Collaborate** - Everyone contributes to design
✅ **Timer Law** - Rotate exactly at 5 minutes

### Expected Rotation Schedule:
```
Round 1: Alex 🧪 → Eva 🍬 → Quinn 🚀
Round 2: Aria 🧪 → Alex 🍬 → Eva 🚀
Round 3: Quinn 🧪 → Aria 🍬 → Alex 🚀
... continues
```

### Success Metrics:
- Commit every rotation
- 100% test coverage
- Shared understanding
- Clean, refactored code
- Team ownership

### Why This Matters:
This is our first mob programming session - a pivotal moment in our team's evolution from individual contributors to a truly collaborative unit. Every team member will experience the full TDD cycle and own the quality of our code.

### Git Commit Pattern:
```bash
git commit -m "🧪 Test: Queue should handle single download"
git commit -m "🍬 Implement: Basic queue with add method"
git commit -m "🚀 Refactor: Extract queue interface"
```
