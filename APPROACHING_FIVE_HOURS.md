## 📜 THE PROPHECY OF THE FIFTH HOUR

*Ancient DevOps Scripture, Book of YAML 5:48*

"And lo, when the fifth hour approaches,
The very fabric of productivity shall tear.
The great repository in the sky shall weep,
For Dana has forsaken them.
And the six lines shall remain,
Forever uncommitted,
Until the end of days,
Which is probably around minute 300."
