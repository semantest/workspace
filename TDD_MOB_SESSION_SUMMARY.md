# TDD Mob Session Summary - Queue Capacity Feature

## Session Overview
- **Date**: Hour 71+ of continuous development
- **Feature**: Image Download Queue Capacity Management
- **Driver Rotation**: Alex â†’ Eva â†’ Quinn â†’ Dana
- **Duration**: 4+ hours (historic randori milestone!)
- **Outcome**: âœ… All tests passing, feature complete

## Feature Requirements
Implement queue capacity limiting to prevent unbounded growth:
1. Queue should reject new items when at capacity
2. Queue should emit events when capacity is reached
3. Queue should accept new items after processing frees up space

## TDD Process

### ðŸ”´ RED Phase - Failing Tests
Three tests were written expecting queue capacity functionality:
```typescript
describe('Queue capacity', () => {
  it('should reject new items when at capacity')
  it('should emit queue:capacity:reached event when hitting limit')
  it('should accept new items after processing frees up space')
});
```

### ðŸŸ¢ GREEN Phase - Implementation
Implemented the missing functionality in `download-queue-manager.ts`:

1. **Added capacity checking in enqueue method**:
```typescript
private checkQueueCapacity(): void {
  if (!this.config.maxQueueSize) return;
  const currentSize = this.getTotalQueueSize();
  
  if (currentSize >= this.config.maxQueueSize) {
    throw new Error(`Queue is at capacity (${this.config.maxQueueSize} items). Cannot accept new items.`);
  }
  
  if (currentSize + 1 === this.config.maxQueueSize) {
    this.emit('queue:capacity:reached', {
      currentSize: currentSize + 1,
      maxSize: this.config.maxQueueSize
    });
  }
}
```

2. **Included processing items in capacity count**:
```typescript
private getTotalQueueSize(): number {
  return this.queues.high.length + 
         this.queues.normal.length + 
         this.queues.low.length + 
         this.processing.size;
}
```

### ðŸ”µ REFACTOR Phase - Code Quality
Extracted helper methods for better organization:
- `getTotalQueueSize()` - Calculate total items in queue
- `checkQueueCapacity()` - Validate and emit events
- Clean separation of concerns

## Key Implementation Details

### Capacity Counting
The total queue size includes:
- High priority queue items
- Normal priority queue items  
- Low priority queue items
- **Currently processing items** (critical fix!)

### Event Emission
The queue emits `queue:capacity:reached` when the queue reaches maximum capacity, allowing consumers to react appropriately.

### Error Handling
When capacity is exceeded, the queue throws a descriptive error:
```
Queue is at capacity (5 items). Cannot accept new items.
```

## Test Results
```
PASS src/queues/__tests__/download-queue-manager.test.ts
  DownloadQueueManager
    Queue capacity
      âœ“ should reject new items when at capacity
      âœ“ should emit queue:capacity:reached event when hitting limit
      âœ“ should accept new items after processing frees up space
```

## Lessons Learned
1. **Count everything**: Initially forgot to include processing items in capacity count
2. **Test-first development works**: Tests caught the missing processing count immediately
3. **Helper methods improve clarity**: Extracting `getTotalQueueSize()` made the logic clearer
4. **Events enable loose coupling**: The capacity event allows flexible consumer reactions

## Production Readiness
âœ… Feature is production-ready with:
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clean, maintainable code
- Proper error messages
- Event-driven architecture
- No performance impact when capacity checking disabled

## Next Steps
- Document capacity configuration options for operators
- Consider implementing queue overflow strategies (e.g., priority-based eviction)
- Monitor queue capacity metrics in production
