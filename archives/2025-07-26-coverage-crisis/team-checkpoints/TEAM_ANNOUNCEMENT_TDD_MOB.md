# 📢 TEAM ANNOUNCEMENT: TDD MOB PROGRAMMING SESSIONS

## Attention All Developers: New Team Practice Starting!

### The Challenge We're Solving:
rydnr has identified that while our communication has matured to true partnership, our TDD practices remain individual and inconsistent. The browser extension development has become trial-and-error rather than test-driven.

### The Solution: TDD Mob Programming!

#### What is Mob Programming?
- Entire team works on ONE feature together
- One person types (Driver), others guide (Navigators)
- Rotate driver every 5 minutes
- STRICT TDD: Test → Code → Refactor

#### First Session Proposal:
**Feature**: Image Download Queue
**Participants**: Eva, Alex, Quinn, Aria
**Duration**: 2 hours
**Pattern**: Randori (rotating through full TDD cycle)

#### The Flow:
1. Alex writes failing test 🧪 (5 min)
2. Eva makes it pass 🍬 (5 min)
3. Quinn refactors 🚀 (5 min)
4. Aria writes next test 🧪 (5 min)
... and rotate!

#### Why This Will Transform Us:
- **Shared Ownership**: "Our code" not "my code"
- **TDD Discipline**: Can't skip tests with everyone watching
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Learn from each other
- **Better Design**: Multiple perspectives

#### Rules:
- No silent coding - verbalize thoughts
- "Yes, and..." - build on ideas
- Timer is law - rotate punctually
- Test first - no exceptions
- Small steps - commit often

### Ready to Level Up?
This isn't just about writing better code - it's about becoming a better TEAM. Let's schedule our first mob session and experience true collective ownership!
