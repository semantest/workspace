## Labels:

- priority-high

## Assignee: Quinn (QA)

## Description:

Eva has completed critical fixes to the Chrome extension and we need immediate testing to verify WebSocket connectivity.

### Prerequisites Completed ✅
- Extension built at `/extension.chrome/build/`
- Port configuration fixed (now using 3003)
- WebSocket handler updated
- Installation guide available at `EXTENSION_INSTALL_GUIDE.md`

### Testing Steps Required:

1. **Load Extension in Chrome**
   - Follow instructions in `EXTENSION_INSTALL_GUIDE.md`
   - Navigate to `chrome://extensions`
   - Enable Developer mode
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select `/extension.chrome/build/` directory

2. **Start WebSocket Server**
   ```bash
   cd semantest/sdk/server
   npm start  # Should run on port 3003
   ```

3. **Test Image Generation**
   ```bash
   ./generate-image.sh "test robot image"
   ```

4. **Verify WebSocket Connection**
   - Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Look for WebSocket connection to `ws://localhost:3003`
   - Check Console for connection success/error messages

### Expected Results:
- ✅ Extension loads without errors
- ✅ WebSocket connects to `ws://localhost:3003`
- ✅ No connection errors in console
- ✅ Events can be sent/received

### Actual Results:
*To be filled by tester*

### Blocking:
- Further extension development
- End-to-end image download testing
- Integration with backend services

### Time Estimate: 30 minutes

### Additional Notes:
- If connection fails, check if server is running on correct port
- Ensure no other services are using port 3003
- Report any console errors verbatim

**This is blocking the entire image download feature. Please prioritize!**
