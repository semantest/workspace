git config --global commit.gpgsign true

```

### 2. ALWAYS Sign Commits
```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Signed commit
git commit -S -m "feat: implement image download handler"

# ‚ùå WRONG - Unsigned commit (REJECTED)
git commit -m "feat: implement image download handler"
```

### 3. ALWAYS Sign Tags
```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Signed tag
git tag -s v1.0.3 -m "Release: Image download feature"

# ‚ùå WRONG - Unsigned tag (REJECTED)
git tag v1.0.3 -m "Release: Image download feature"
```

### 4. Update GitHub Issues
