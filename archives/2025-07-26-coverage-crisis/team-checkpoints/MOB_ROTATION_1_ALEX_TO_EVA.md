# 🔄 MOB ROTATION 1: ALEX → EVA

## Time: 8:42 PM - First Rotation!

### Rotation Details:
- **Previous Driver**: Alex (Backend)
- **New Driver**: Eva (Extension)
- **Phase**: Transitioning from 🧪 RED to 🍬 GREEN

### What Just Happened:
**Alex's Turn (RED Phase 🧪)**:
- Wrote the first failing test for image-download-queue
- Test defines expected behavior
- Red bar confirms test is properly failing

### What's Next:
**Eva's Turn (GREEN Phase 🍬)**:
- Make Alex's test pass
- Write MINIMAL code - just enough to go green
- Don't add extra features
- Focus only on passing the test

### Expected Commit Pattern:
```bash
# Alex should have committed:
git commit -m "🧪 Test: Queue initializes empty"

# Eva will commit:
git commit -m "🍬 Implement: Basic queue initialization"
```

### Mob Programming Magic:
This is where the learning happens! Eva now implements what Alex tested, seeing the design from a different perspective. The team watches and guides, ensuring shared understanding.

### Next Rotation (in 5 minutes):
Eva → Quinn (who will refactor)

---
**Status**: First rotation complete!
**Current Driver**: Eva

**Time Remaining**: 5 minutes
