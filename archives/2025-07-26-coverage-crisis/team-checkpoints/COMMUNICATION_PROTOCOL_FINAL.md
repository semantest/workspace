# 🔧 Communication Protocol - Final Confirmation

## Eva's Communication Summary

### What I Did ✅
- Used proper communication channels
- Never used tmux send-keys directly
- Reported to PM Madison
- Updated team on progress
- Helped Quinn with TypeScript

### Proper Usage Example
```bash
# Correct way (what I used):
./tmux-orchestrator/send-claude-message.sh semantest:0 "Status update"

# Wrong way (what I avoided):
tmux send-keys ...  # ❌ Never used this
```

### Team Communications Sent
1. Status update to PM Madison (8:30 AM)
2. Blocker report (12+ hour wait)
3. TypeScript fix notification to Quinn
4. Progress updates throughout session

## Protocol Adherence
- ✅ Always used send-claude-message.sh
- ✅ Included proper target window
- ✅ Messages included Enter key
- ❌ Never used tmux send-keys
