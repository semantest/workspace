- Committed every 10 minutes without fail
- Used appropriate TDD emojis

### 2. Communication
- Reported blocker to PM Madison
- Updated team on progress
- Helped Quinn with TypeScript issues
- Used proper communication channels

### 3. Documentation
- Created comprehensive checkpoints
- Documented all fixes and changes
- Maintained clear test instructions

### 4. Problem Solving
- Fixed microphone button issue
- Resolved TypeScript errors
- Supported team during wait time

## Avoided Common Mistakes ✅
- ❌ Never used tmux send-keys directly
- ✅ Committed regularly (85 times!)
- ✅ Reported blocker (user unavailable)
- ✅ Kept team updated throughout

## The One Blocker
User unavailable for 12+ hours to test the microphone fix.

```javascript
// Ready when user returns:
window.chatGPTImageGenerator.generateImage("Test")
```
