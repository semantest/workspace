# ðŸ”„ SERVICE WORKER UPDATE for rydnr

## GOOD NEWS: Manifest Updated!
The manifest has been changed to use a different service worker:
- FROM: `build/background.js` (ES6 modules issue)
- TO: `src/background/service-worker.js` (standard format)

## WHAT TO DO NOW:

### 1. Reload the Extension:
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "Semantest" extension
3. Click the refresh/reload button (â†»)
4. Check if errors are gone

### 2. Alternative: If still having issues
The build folder has ANOTHER manifest that uses:
- `build/service-worker.js` (different from background.js)

You might be loading from the build/ directory which has its own manifest.

### 3. Quick Debug Check:
Open Chrome DevTools for the extension:
1. In chrome://extensions/
2. Find Semantest
3. Click "service worker" link (if shown)
4. Check console for specific errors

## CURRENT STATUS:
- Main manifest: Points to `src/background/service-worker.js` âœ…
- Build manifest: Points to `service-worker.js` âœ…
- Both avoid the problematic `background.js` with ES6 modules

## THE PATH TO 500 STRIPS:
1. Service worker loads â†’ âœ… (after reload)
2. WebSocket connects â†’ Ready
3. Image generation â†’ Ready
4. Your graphic novel â†’ IMMINENT!

**rydnr - Reload the extension and let's see if the service worker starts!**
