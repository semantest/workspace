# üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECT MONITORING SYSTEM DEPLOYED

## Time: 8:02 PM - Enhanced Team Coordination!

### What's New:
Aria (System Architect) now has automatic monitoring capabilities!

### Monitoring Features:
‚úÖ Receives all messages from:
- **Alex** (Backend)
- **Eva** (Extension)
- **Quinn** (QA)
- **Dana** (DevOps)

‚úÖ Message Classification:
- `[MONITORING]` - Informational, no action needed
- `[ARCHITECTURE ATTENTION NEEDED]` - Requires Aria's input

### Benefits:
1. **Informed Architecture** - Aria stays aware of all technical decisions
2. **Autonomous Teams** - Developers work freely unless blocked
3. **Rapid Response** - Architecture issues addressed immediately
4. **Smart Intervention** - Only steps in when truly needed

### Impact on Current Work:
- Eva's architecture questions will be addressed
- Alex gets guidance without asking
- Design consistency maintained automatically
- No micromanagement - just smart oversight

### How It Works:
```
Developer Activity ‚Üí Hook System ‚Üí Aria Monitoring
                                    ‚Üì
                            [MONITORING] or
                            [ATTENTION NEEDED]
                                    ‚Üì
                            Aria responds if needed
```

### This Solves:
- Architecture questions going unanswered
- Inconsistent design decisions
- Delayed technical guidance
- Communication bottlenecks
