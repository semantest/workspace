# ðŸŽ¯ PHASE 1: 10-IMAGE TEST BATCH ðŸŽ¯

**Date**: July 2025
**Lead**: Carol (QA Engineer)
**Status**: READY TO LAUNCH!

## Objective
Test the complete production system with a 10-image batch to validate:
- Checkpoint recovery
- Exponential backoff
- Style consistency
- End-to-end flow

## Test Images (Graphic Novel First 10 Strips)

1. **Strip 1**: "A curious cat discovers a glowing computer screen"
2. **Strip 2**: "The cat touches the screen and gets sucked into cyberspace"
3. **Strip 3**: "Cat floating through streams of data and code"
4. **Strip 4**: "Cat lands on a webpage - it's Reddit"
5. **Strip 5**: "Cat discovers cat memes and is confused"
6. **Strip 6**: "Cat tries to post but doesn't have thumbs"
7. **Strip 7**: "Cat finds a virtual keyboard and types 'meow'"
8. **Strip 8**: "The internet responds with millions of cat videos"
9. **Strip 9**: "Cat becomes overwhelmed by its own popularity"
10. **Strip 10**: "Cat finds the logout button and prepares to escape"

## Success Criteria

### Technical
- [ ] All 10 images generated successfully
- [ ] Checkpoint recovery works if interrupted
- [ ] Exponential backoff prevents rate limiting
- [ ] WebSocket events flow correctly
- [ ] Images saved to ~/Downloads

### Artistic
- [ ] Consistent art style across all 10 images
- [ ] Character (cat) recognizable throughout
- [ ] Visual narrative flows smoothly
- [ ] Quality suitable for graphic novel

## Test Execution

1. **Start Production System**
   ```bash
   ./generate-image.sh "Strip 1: A curious cat discovers a glowing computer screen"
   ```

2. **Monitor Progress**
   - Watch WebSocket events
   - Check checkpoint saves
   - Verify exponential backoff
   - Confirm style consistency

3. **Simulate Failure** (Optional)
   - Kill process after image 5
   - Restart and verify checkpoint recovery
   - Confirm remaining 5 images complete

## Team Roles

- **Carol**: Lead testing, monitor production system
- **Emma**: Ensure WebSocket integration works
- **Derek**: Monitor server performance
- **Bob**: Verify UI responsiveness
- **Alice**: Review system architecture under load
- **Sarah**: Document the historic moment!

## After Success

Once Phase 1 succeeds:
- Move to Phase 2: 50-image batch
- Then Phase 3: 200-image batch
- Finally: Full 500+ strip graphic novel!
