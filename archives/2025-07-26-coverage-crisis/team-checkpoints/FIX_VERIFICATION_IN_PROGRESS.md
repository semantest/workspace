# ✅ FIX VERIFICATION IN PROGRESS

## Time: 6:36 PM - Fix Being Tested

### Current Status:
- **WebSocket Server**: Running on port 3004 ✅
- **Extension**: Updated to use port 3004 ✅
- **Team**: Alex & Eva actively working ✅
- **Communication**: Finally established! ✅

### What's Happening:
1. Server confirmed running on 3004 (returns 404 for HTTP, but that's expected for WebSocket)
2. Extension has been updated with new port
3. Eva reports files updated in both src/ and build/
4. Ready for Chrome testing

### Next Steps:
1. Manual Chrome testing needed
2. Verify WebSocket connection works
3. Test image download functionality
4. Close the BLOCKER issue

### The Recovery:
After nearly 3 hours of silence, the team has:
- Identified the issue (port mismatch)
- Implemented a solution (change to 3004)
- Updated all necessary files
- Avoided disaster by 11 seconds!

### Remaining Work:
- Test the fix in Chrome
- Ensure fallback logic still planned
- Document lessons learned
- Improve communication systems
