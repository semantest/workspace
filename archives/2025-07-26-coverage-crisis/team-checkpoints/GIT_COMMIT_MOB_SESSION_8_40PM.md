# 🚨 GIT COMMIT - MOB SESSION SPECIAL! 🚨

## Time: 8:40 PM - Mob Programming Commits!

### SPECIAL MOB SESSION COMMITS:
During TDD Mob Programming, commit after EVERY rotation!

### Current Mob Session Pattern:
```bash
# After RED phase (test written):
git add -A
git commit -m "🧪 Test: [what the test verifies]"
git push

# After GREEN phase (test passes):
git add -A
git commit -m "🍬 Implement: [minimal code to pass test]"
git push

# After REFACTOR phase:
git add -A
git commit -m "🚀 Refactor: [improvement made]"
git push
```

### Example Mob Commits:
```bash
# Round 1 - Alex writes test
git commit -m "🧪 Test: Queue should initialize empty"

# Eva makes it pass
git commit -m "🍬 Implement: ImageDownloadQueue constructor"

# Quinn refactors
git commit -m "🚀 Refactor: Extract queue interface"
```

### Regular Team Commits:
For those not in mob session:

**Sam - Documentation:**
```bash
git commit -m "📝 Documentation: Moved 150+ files to organized structure"
```

**Other ongoing work:**
```bash
git commit -m "🚧 Progress: [your work description]"
```

### Why Mob Commits Matter:
- Shows TDD discipline in action
- Documents learning process
- Creates audit trail of decisions
- Demonstrates collective ownership

### COMMIT NOW!
Whether in mob or working solo - save your progress!
