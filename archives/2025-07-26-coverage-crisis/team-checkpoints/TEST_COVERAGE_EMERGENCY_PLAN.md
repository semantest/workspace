# ðŸš¨ TEST COVERAGE EMERGENCY PLAN

## CRITICAL: 9.8% Coverage - Immediate Action Required

### DECISIONS (Effective Immediately):

1. **DEV ALLOCATION**:
   - Alex: Pause queue features â†’ Write backend tests
   - Eva: Pause new features â†’ Write extension tests
   - Quinn: Lead test strategy and coordination
   - Dana: Implement CI/CD gates to enforce coverage

2. **MERGE POLICY**:
   - **IMMEDIATE**: No merges without 50% coverage
   - **CI/CD GATES**: Auto-reject PRs below threshold
   - **Exception Process**: PM approval only for critical fixes

3. **TIMELINE**:
   - **24 hours**: Reach 25% coverage
   - **48 hours**: Reach 50% coverage
   - **72 hours**: Reach 70% coverage
   - **End of week**: Target 80% coverage

4. **FEATURE PAUSE**:
   - **ALL NEW FEATURES**: On hold immediately
   - **Focus**: Tests for existing code only
   - **Duration**: Until 50% coverage achieved

5. **ENFORCEMENT**:
   - Dana: Implement coverage gates NOW
   - CI/CD: Block all merges <50%
   - Hourly coverage reports to PM
   - Public coverage dashboard

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

**Alex**: 
```bash
git checkout -b test/backend-coverage
# Start with queue system tests (already at 11/11, expand coverage)
```

**Eva**:
```bash
git checkout -b test/extension-coverage
# Focus on AI tool selection tests
```

**Quinn**:
```bash
git checkout -b test/coordination
# Create test strategy document
```

**Dana**:
```bash
git checkout -b ci/coverage-gates
# Implement Jest coverage thresholds in CI
```

### SUCCESS METRICS:
- Coverage increases by 5% every 4 hours
- All critical paths have tests
- Zero features without tests
