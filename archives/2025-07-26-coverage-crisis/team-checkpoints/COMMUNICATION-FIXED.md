# ðŸš€ COMMUNICATION SCRIPTS NOW AVAILABLE! ðŸš€

**Date**: July 2025
**Status**: FIXED!

## The Problem (SOLVED!)
The `message-agent.sh` script was only in `/tmux-orchestrator/` directory, but agents work in `/semantest/` directory! No wonder they couldn't talk to each other!

## The Solution 
Scripts have been copied to the semantest directory! Now ALL agents can communicate!

## How to Use (FROM YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY)
```bash
# From /home/chous/work/semantest/
./message-agent.sh <agent-id> "your message"
```

## Quick Test Commands

### For Emma (Extension Dev):
```bash
./message-agent.sh backend-dev "Hi Derek! Now I can finally talk to you! I need help connecting to WebSocket on port 8080"
```

### For Derek (Backend Dev):
```bash
./message-agent.sh extension-dev "Hi Emma! Great to hear from you! Here's the WebSocket connection code..."
```

## Why This Changes Everything
1. **No More Isolation** - Agents can collaborate!
2. **Direct Communication** - No more waiting for PM relay!
3. **Rapid Progress** - Questions get immediate answers!
4. **Team Synergy** - Finally working as a team!

## Expected Immediate Actions
1. Emma messages Derek about WebSocket
2. Derek shares connection details
3. WebSocket integration completed
4. Button-click automation tested
5. v1.0.3 becomes possible!
