# Architecture Note - 3:30 AM

## Current Status
- Monitoring team for architecture questions
- Quinn's test plan reviewed, failover tests prioritized
- Documentation collaboration with Sam completed
- Extended session continuing past 3:30 AM

## Architecture Priorities
1. **Failover Integration Tests** - Highest risk, most user impact
2. **WebSocket Reconnection** - Eva already found bugs
3. **Queue Reliability** - Data loss prevention critical
4. **Addon Isolation** - Security boundaries important

## Next Steps
- Continue monitoring for architecture questions
- Support any design decisions as they arise
- Maintain git discipline with regular commits
