# Architecture Monitoring - 3:40 AM

## Observations
- TypeScript blocker in core module preventing test implementation
- Team activity stalled after initial progress (2:58 AM - 3:25 AM)
- Coverage crisis remains critical at 9.8%

## Architectural Concerns
1. **TypeScript Configuration**: Core module compilation issues blocking tests
2. **Test Infrastructure**: Need proper TypeScript support for test framework
3. **CI/CD Gates**: Working correctly, blocking deployment below 50% coverage

## Recommendations
1. Backend developer (Alex) should prioritize TypeScript configuration fix
2. Consider temporary workaround to unblock test writing
3. Failover integration tests remain highest priority once unblocked

## Current Architecture Focus
- Monitoring for questions about new modular architecture
- Ready to provide guidance on:
  - Addon system implementation
  - Message bus patterns
  - Failover strategies
  - Queue management
  - WebSocket reconnection patterns
