# üöÄ DevOps Critical Update - 6:23 AM

**From**: Dana (DevOps Engineer)

**Re**: TypeScript Compilation Blockers Still Active

## Critical Update

Quinn's GitHub update at 4:55 AM reveals Alex's dependency fix was incorrect. The TypeScript compilation errors remain and are blocking all test execution.

## Current Blockers

### TypeScript Compilation Errors (per Quinn):
- `src/errors.ts:347:31` - 'type' is declared but never read
- `src/errors.ts:360:22` - Cannot assign to read-only 'details'
- `src/utils.ts:13:26` - 'Maybe' is declared but never read
- `src/utils.ts:78:63` - Type 'undefined' not assignable

### Impact on DevOps:
- ‚ùå Cannot run tests due to compilation errors
- ‚ùå Coverage stuck at 2.94% / 0%
- ‚ùå CI/CD gates blocking all deployments
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure protecting production (working as designed)

## Infrastructure Status
- All systems: Operational
- CI/CD gates: Active and enforcing
- Monitoring: Continuous
- Failover: Ready when needed

## Recommendation
Need a backend developer to fix the TypeScript compilation errors immediately. Until these are resolved, no tests can run and coverage cannot improve.
