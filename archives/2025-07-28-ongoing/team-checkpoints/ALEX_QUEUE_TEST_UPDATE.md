# ðŸ§ª Alex - Queue Testing Progress Update

## Time: 7:39 PM - Comprehensive Test Coverage!

### âœ… Test Coverage Added:
- Priority queue handling
- Event emission verification
- Queue status/metrics endpoints
- Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) operations
- Cancellation logic

### ðŸ“Š Current Status:
- **Test Results**: 9/11 passing
- **Success Rate**: 82%

### ðŸ”„ Issues Found:
1. **Processing intervals aren't cleaned up**
   - Causing Jest open handles warning
   - Need proper cleanup in afterEach/afterAll

2. **State Requirements**:
   - completeProcessing needs items in processing state first
   - failProcessing needs items in processing state first
   - Tests need to properly simulate state transitions

### ðŸ”§ Currently Working On:
- Fixing interval cleanup for proper test isolation
- Ensuring all timers/intervals are cleared after tests
- Preventing Jest warnings about open handles

### Next Steps:
1. Fix interval cleanup
2. Ensure proper state transitions in tests
3. Get to 11/11 passing tests
4. Add edge case coverage
