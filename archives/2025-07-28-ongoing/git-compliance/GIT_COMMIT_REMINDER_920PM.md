# or if implementing:
git commit -m "🚧 Work in progress: Adding explicit tool click functionality"
```

**Alex - AI Queue Integration:**
```bash
git commit -m "🏅 Task complete: AI tool support in queue with retry logic"
# or if still testing:
git commit -m "🧪 New test: AI tool activation event handling"
```

**Sam - Documentation Progress:**

```

### 💡 Today's Breakthroughs to Preserve:
- ✅ Explicit AI tool selection discovery
- ✅ Queue AI tool integration
- ✅ Event system for tool activation
- ✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff
- ✅ 9/11 queue tests passing

### TDD Emoji Quick Reference:
- 💡 **Idea/planning** - Discoveries, designs
- 🧪 **New test** - Test coverage added
- 🍬 **Naive implementation** - First attempt
- 🚧 **Work in progress** - Still building
- 🚀 **Refactored** - Improved code
- 📝 **Documentation** - Docs/comments
- 🏅 **Task complete** - Feature done!

### WHY COMMIT NOW:
- Eva's breakthrough discovery needs preservation
- Alex's AI queue work is critical infrastructure
- Every 10 minutes = potential progress lost
- These are MAJOR advances today!
