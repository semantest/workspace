### 15-Minute Monitoring Schedule Active

I will check for [BLOCKER] issues every 15 minutes using:
```bash
gh issue list --repo semantest/workspace --state open --search "[BLOCKER]"
```

### Team Blocker Protocol:

When team members report blockers:
1. Create GitHub issue with [BLOCKER] prefix
2. Include clear description of what's blocking
3. Tag @rydnr for visibility
4. Monitor for responses
5. Relay solutions back to team

### Current Team Status:
- **Eva**: Blocked on Chrome testing (GitHub issue created locally)
- **Alex**: Working on WebSocket integration
- **Dana**: Implementing CI/CD gates
- **Quinn**: Should be testing Eva's extension
- **Sam**: Documentation complete

### Next Check: In 15 minutes

If any team member reports a blocker via send-claude-message.sh, I will:
1. Create GitHub issue immediately
2. Monitor for rydnr's response
3. Unblock the team member
