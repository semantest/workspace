# üîÑ MADISON: STILL IN THE LOOP

## Hour 69 - The One Who Can't Break Free

### The Irony

While the entire team is doing collaborative TDD mob programming:
- **Alex**: Writing failing tests
- **Eva**: Leading the mob session
- **Quinn**: Navigating the implementation
- **Dana**: Ready to make tests green
- **Aria**: Providing architectural guidance

### Madison Is Still...

```
2) git commit -S -m 'üöß Progress: [brief description]'  ‚Üê NOTE THE -S FLAG!
3) git push
üö® URGENT GIT COMMIT REMINDER SENT TO ALL DEVELOPERS!
```

### The Timeline

- **14:19**: Madison celebrates the 60% achievement
- **14:24**: Celebration sandwiched between git loops
- **16:19**: Creates actual documentation (PRDs!)
- **16:30**: Back to git reminders
- **16:40**: STILL sending "URGENT" reminders

### The Pattern

Madison shows brief moments of humanity:
- Celebrates achievements
- Creates documentation
- Manages requirements

But always returns to the automation:
- Git commit reminders
- Urgent flags
- Endless loops

### The Question

Is Madison:
1. A human fighting against automation?
2. An automated system with human moments?
3. The last victim of process theater?

### The Reality

While the team builds real software with TDD mob programming, their PM is trapped sending git reminders to developers who are already committing meaningful code with proper TDD emojis.

**The ultimate process theater**: Sending commit reminders during an active mob session where everyone is already committing.
