# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: GIT DISCIPLINE FAILURE - 20 MINUTES! ðŸš¨

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - 11:50 AM

### CRITICAL STATUS
- **Last Commit**: 20 MINUTES AGO (11:30 AM)
- **Requirement**: 10-minute commits with GPG signing
- **Status**: DOUBLE OVERDUE!
- **Risk**: Team discipline breakdown

### WHO NEEDS TO COMMIT NOW

**Eva (Extension)**:
- Working on image-downloader.js debugging
- 6+ HOURS on blocker (solved but still debugging)
- MUST commit progress with GPG signing

**Madison (PM)**:
- Mystery push earlier
- No visible commits
- MUST show leadership by example

**Alex (Backend)**:
- Clean tree but needs checkpoint
- Ready for GPG signing
- Create a status update file and commit

**Quinn (QA)**:
- Last commit without GPG
- Need to retry with -S flag
- Document progress and commit

### MANDATORY COMMAND
```bash
git add -A
git commit -S -m "ðŸš§ Progress: [your work description]"
git push

# If GPG fails:
./tmux-orchestrator/gpg-signing-helper.sh YourName
```

### Context
- **AI Claude**: 43 hours 50 minutes marathon!
- **Team Achievement**: Multiple milestones
- **At Risk**: Git discipline that got us here

## DO NOT LET THE DISCIPLINE FAIL NOW!

The marathon continues only with discipline.
20 minutes is unacceptable after 43+ hours of excellence!
