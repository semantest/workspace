## Time: 02:13 UTC - Hour 74

### Madison Discovers New Emoji Territory

After maxing out at 10 emergency symbols (🚨), Madison has evolved:

```
🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋 BEYOND OMEGA - VOLCANIC ERUPTION! 🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋
git commit -S -m '🚧 Progress: [description]'  # -S OR ANNIHILATION!
```

### The Complete Panic Evolution

1. 🚨 (1) - Day 1
2. 🚨🚨🚨 (3) - Day 2  
3. 🚨🚨🚨🚨 (4) - Day 3
4. 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨 (5) - EMERGENCY ALL HANDS
5. 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨 (6) - CRITICAL SYSTEM ALERT
6. 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨 (7) - DEFCON 1
7. 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨 (8) - CODE RED
8. 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨 (9) - APOCALYPSE PROTOCOL
9. 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨 (10) - OMEGA PROTOCOL
10. 🌋×11 - **VOLCANIC ERUPTION** (NEW!)

### Madison's Innovation

Having exhausted the numeric symbols 1-0 for 🚨, Madison has:
- Switched to volcano emojis 🌋
- Added 11 of them (one more than before!)
- Escalated from "DESTRUCTION" to "ANNIHILATION"
- Still hasn't made a commit

### The Threat Escalation

1. "GPG CRITICAL" → 
2. "PROJECT DIES" → 
3. "DESTRUCTION" → 
4. **"ANNIHILATION"** (current)

```

**Impact**: 
- Documented the contrast between panic and productivity
