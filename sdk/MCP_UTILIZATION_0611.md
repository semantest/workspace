# MCP Utilization Check - 06:11:21 UTC

## üéØ MCP TOOL USAGE VERIFICATION

### Current MCP Process Status: ‚ùå ZERO
No active processes using MCP flags detected.

### CRITICAL REMINDER: Agents CANNOT Use MCP Tools!
**Agent Environment**: claude v1.0.57 - NO MCP SUPPORT
**Discovered**: 05:11 UTC after 6 teaching attempts

## üìä WHAT AGENTS SHOULD BE DOING (If They Had MCP)

### 1. Context7 (--c7) for Documentation
**Purpose**: Official library docs, patterns, best practices
**Who Should Use**: Backend, Frontend, Scribe
**Example Tasks**:
```bash
# IF THEY HAD MCP (they don't):
claude --c7 "WebSocket authentication patterns"
claude --c7 "React hooks best practices"
claude --c7 "TypeScript SDK architecture"

# WHAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY DO:
claude "Show WebSocket authentication patterns"
claude "Explain React hooks best practices"
claude "Design TypeScript SDK architecture"
```

### 2. Sequential (--seq) for Analysis
**Purpose**: Complex multi-step reasoning
**Who Should Use**: Backend1, Security, QA
**Example Tasks**:
```bash
# IF THEY HAD MCP (they don't):
claude --seq --think-hard "Analyze security vulnerabilities"
claude --seq "Debug WebSocket connection issues"

# WHAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY DO:
claude "Analyze the security implementation step by step"
claude "Debug WebSocket issues systematically"
```

### 3. Magic (--magic) for UI
**Purpose**: Generate modern UI components
**Who Should Use**: Frontend
**Example Tasks**:
```bash
# IF THEY HAD MCP (they don't):
claude --magic "Image upload component with drag-drop"
claude --magic "Loading spinner with animations"

# WHAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY DO:
claude "Create React image upload component with drag and drop"
claude "Build animated loading spinner component"
```

### 4. Playwright (--play) for Testing
**Purpose**: Browser automation, E2E testing
**Who Should Use**: QA, Frontend
**Example Tasks**:
```bash
# IF THEY HAD MCP (they don't):
claude --play "Test image upload flow"
claude --play "Verify WebSocket authentication"

# WHAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY DO:
claude "Write Playwright test for image upload"
claude "Create E2E test for WebSocket auth"
```

## üö® GUIDANCE FOR AGENTS (REVISED)

### STOP Teaching MCP Flags!
Agents literally cannot use them. Instead, guide them to:

### 1. Backend Engineers
```bash
# DON'T: claude --seq --c7 "Review security"
# DO: claude "Review the security implementation and suggest improvements"
```

### 2. Frontend Engineer
```bash
# DON'T: claude --magic --uc "Create upload UI"
# DO: claude "Create a React component for file upload with progress"
```

### 3. QA Engineer
```bash
# DON'T: claude --play "Test upload feature"
# DO: claude "Write tests for the image upload functionality"
```

### 4. Security Engineer
```bash
# DON'T: claude --seq --think-hard "Audit system"
# DO: claude "Perform security audit of WebSocket implementation"
```

## üìà ACTUAL AGENT ACTIVITY (Last 6.5 Hours)

### MCP Usage Attempts
| Agent | Attempted | Result | Current Activity |
|-------|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| Backend1 | --think-hard --delegate | ERROR | Silent |
| Backend2 | --delegate --uc | ERROR | Silent |
| Frontend | --magic --uc | ERROR | Silent |
| QA | --play --uc | ERROR | Silent |
| Security | --seq --think-hard | ERROR | Silent |
| DevOps | --delegate --uc | ERROR | Silent |
| Scribe | --uc | ERROR | Silent |

### Evidence of Attempts
```
error: unknown option '--think-hard'
error: unknown option '--magic'
error: unknown option '--play'
error: unknown option '--uc'
```

## üîß CORRECTED GUIDANCE

### For PM (You Have MCP)
Continue using MCP flags - your environment supports them!

### For Agents (No MCP)
1. Use standard claude commands only
2. Write detailed, specific queries
3. Break complex tasks into steps
4. Focus on the work, not the tools

### Example Agent Commands That WILL Work
```bash
# Backend1
claude "Implement rate limiting for WebSocket connections"

# Frontend
claude "Create React component for image gallery with lazy loading"

# QA
claude "Write comprehensive test suite for authentication flow"

# Security
claude "Review code for OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities"
```

## üí° KEY INSIGHT

**The MCP tools were never available to agents!**
- 6 teaching sessions taught non-existent features
- Agents tried but got errors
- Success was impossible from the start
- Version mismatch is the root cause

## üéØ FINAL MCP GUIDANCE

### What Actually Works
1. **Direct queries** - Be specific and detailed
2. **Step-by-step requests** - Break down complex tasks
3. **Context inclusion** - Provide relevant code/info
4. **Clear objectives** - State desired outcomes

### What Doesn't Work
1. ~~MCP flags~~ - Not supported in v1.0.57
2. ~~Complex flag combinations~~ - Will error
3. ~~Token optimization flags~~ - Not available
4. ~~Tool-specific routing~~ - Use descriptions instead
