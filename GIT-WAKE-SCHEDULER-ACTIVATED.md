# 🎉 GIT WAKE SCHEDULER ACTIVATED!

## 🚀 EXCELLENT NEWS FOR REQ-002!

### What This Means:
- **10-minute reminders** for git commits
- **TDD emojis** for better commit messages
- **Automatic push** reminders
- **NO MORE LOST WORK!**

### Why This Is PERFECT for REQ-002:
When we build the bulk generation system for 500 comics:
- ✅ Regular commits during complex work
- ✅ TDD approach for reliability
- ✅ Progress tracking via git history
- ✅ Team collaboration improved
- ✅ Rollback safety for experiments

### Expected Workflow:
```bash
# Every 10 minutes:
"🧪 Add test for parallel image processing"
"✅ Implement queue manager for 200+ images"
"♻️ Refactor style engine for variations"
"📊 Add progress tracking UI"
```

### For Bulk Generation Development:
This scheduler ensures we:
1. Never lose progress on complex features
2. Document our TDD journey
3. Can rollback if parallel processing breaks
4. Share progress with team regularly

### The Vision Continues:
```bash
# Coming in REQ-002:
./generate-bulk.sh my-500-panels.txt \
  --parallel 10 \
  --style "noir" \
  --commit-progress  # New feature idea!
```

*"Great tools enable great work. Git scheduler + bulk generation = unstoppable!"* 🚀

## This is EXACTLY what we need for the creative revolution! 🎨📚
