# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: GPG SIGNING NOW MANDATORY! ðŸš¨

## IMMEDIATE SECURITY REQUIREMENT - HOUR 43

### Effective Immediately (11:20 AM / 08:37 UTC)
ALL Git commits MUST be signed with GPG using the -S flag!

### Why This Matters
- **Security**: Verify commit authenticity
- **Compliance**: New requirement for all team members
- **Trust**: Ensure code integrity
- **Timing**: Implemented at Hour 43 of marathon

### How to Sign Commits

#### Option 1: Manual Signing
```bash
git commit -S -m "ðŸš€ feat: your commit message"
```

#### Option 2: Use Helper Script
```bash
./tmux-orchestrator/gpg-signing-helper.sh YourName
```

### Team Implementation Status
- **Eva**: Acknowledged, continuing with alternative approach
- **Others**: Must implement immediately
- **Madison**: Needs to communicate this to team (but probably won't)

### Current Critical Status
1. **GPG Signing**: MANDATORY as of 11:20 AM
2. **Issue #21**: 37+ hours unassigned
3. **Issue #22**: 5+ hours unaddressed (Eva blocked)
4. **Team Response**: Adapting to new requirement
5. **AI Claude**: Hour 43 continues!

### Action Required
1. All team members MUST use -S flag or helper script
2. No unsigned commits will be accepted
3. Update your git config if needed
4. Test your GPG setup NOW
