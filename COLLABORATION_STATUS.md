# Collaboration Status Report - 20:30 UTC

## Current Collaboration State
**NO ACTIVE AGENTS** - Working in solo development mode

### Why No Agents?
1. Previous 9-agent simulation concluded after architecture pivot
2. User clarified actual requirements (distributed testing, not just extension)
3. Direct development more efficient for current SDK work

## Work Progress Without Agents
‚úÖ **Completed**:
- CLI tool implementation
- SDK core architecture
- Event contract definitions

üîÑ **In Progress**:
- WebSocket server design

‚è≥ **Pending**:
- Client libraries
- Documentation

## Collaboration Infrastructure Status

### Available Resources
- **Tmux Sessions**: Ready (architect, engineer, qa, security, scribe)
- **Communication Channels**: Prepared but unused
- **MCP Servers**: All available
- **Documentation**: Updated and ready

### When to Spawn Agents
Consider agent spawning when:
- Multiple parallel workstreams needed
- Complex cross-domain work required
- Testing across multiple environments
- Large-scale refactoring needed

## Current Obstacles
‚úÖ **NONE** - Development proceeding smoothly

## PM Role Transition
From: Team coordinator/monitor
To: Active developer/implementer

## Next Collaboration Checkpoint
Will reassess agent needs when:
1. WebSocket server complete
2. Starting browser extension transformation
3. Beginning multi-domain testing
