# QA Status Update - 4:00 AM

**Engineer**: Quinn (QA)
**Crisis Duration**: 5 hours

## Current Status
- **Test Coverage**: Still at catastrophic levels
  - nodejs.server: 2.94%
  - core: 0% (BLOCKED)
- **Blocker**: TypeScript compilation errors in core module
- **Tests Created**: 4 comprehensive test files
- **Tests Runnable**: 2 (nodejs.server only)
- **Team Response**: Minimal - still waiting for backend developer

## Actions Taken
1. Created emergency tests for core and nodejs.server
2. Updated GitHub Issue #21 multiple times
3. Communicated with PM Madison and Architect Aria
4. Maintained strict git discipline throughout

## Next Steps
- Continue waiting for backend developer to fix TypeScript errors
- Once fixed, immediately run core module tests
- Target: Get coverage above 50% within 24 hours of fix
