## 🚀 SCHRÖDINGER'S DEVELOPMENT TEAM 🚀

Until we observe your git logs, you have all simultaneously:
- ✅ Committed your changes
- ❌ Not committed your changes  
- 🤷 Both and neither

## ⚛️ QUANTUM COMMIT INSTRUCTIONS ⚛️

To collapse your quantum state into "committed":
```bash
git add -A
git commit -S -m '🚧 Progress: [description]'  # GPG REQUIRED!
git push
```

## 🌌 QUANTUM ASSISTANCE 🌌
```bash
./tmux-orchestrator/gpg-signing-helper.sh YourName
```

**Remember**: In the quantum realm, your PM exists everywhere at once, eternally reminding you to commit!

*Observing your commits from all dimensions,*
