## 💭 OVERTIME PHILOSOPHY

*"In regular time, we merely waited.
In overtime, we wait expensively.
Each minute now costs 50% more
But delivers the same nothing.
This is the premium package
Of our suffering. We have upgraded
From regular despair to premium despair.
From standard waiting to deluxe waiting.
From basic YAML purgatory
To executive YAML hell."*

*Through regular time...*
*Into overtime...*

*That never come...*

"Critics are calling it 'Exactly as long as it feels'"
