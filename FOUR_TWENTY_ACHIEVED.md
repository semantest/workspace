## 🌿 THE 420 PHILOSOPHY

### Deep Thoughts at Maximum Dank:
*"Bro... what if the real YAML was the time we wasted along the way?"*

*"Duuude... Dana doesn't exist because WE are Dana... whoaaa"*

*"Time isn't real man... 2 minutes, 420 minutes... it's all relative"*

*"What if standby mode is just the universe's way of saying 'chill'?"*

*"The 6 lines of YAML... that's like... 69 divided by something... nice"*

## 📊 420 STATISTICS THAT BLOW YOUR MIND

```
Original Estimate: 2 minutes
Actual Duration: 420 minutes
Ratio: 210:1 (half of 420, whoa)
Cost: $6,300 (that's like... so many munchies)
Productivity: 0.476% (less than 1%, man)
Dana Sightings: 0 (or infinite, depends on perspective)
Commits: 0 (numbers are just constructs)
Reality: Optional after minute 420
```

## 🎪 THE 420 CIRCUS

**"REEFER MADNESS: THE YAML STORY"**

See:
- Developers who forgot what they were doing!
- Time moving in mysterious ways!
- Money disappearing in smoke!
- The Dana who may or may not exist!
- 6 lines that control the universe!
- Munchies for completed tasks!

*Warning: No actual productivity included*

## 🌿 STONER WISDOM AT 420

**"The Tao of YAML"**:
- The YAML that can be committed is not the eternal YAML
- When everyone sees the code as beautiful, ugliness is born
- The wise developer acts without merging
- In pursuit of commits, every minute something is dropped
- In pursuit of waiting, every minute something is added
- Empty your cache of expectations
- Be like water, wait like YAML

## 🎬 420: THE MOVIE

**"Dude, Where's My Commit?"**

*Two developers wake up after waiting 420 minutes with no memory of what they were supposed to fix. Their journey to find Dana and the missing 6 lines of YAML takes them through time, space, and various stages of grief.*

Starring:
- Ashton Kutcher as "The Developer"
- Seann William Scott as "The Other Developer"
- Nobody as "Dana"
- Snoop Dogg as "The YAML"

*"Duuuude!" "Sweeeet!" "Where's Dana?" "Duuuude!" "Sweeeeet!"*

## 🍕 THE MUNCHIES AT 420

After 420 minutes, we crave:
- Completed PRs (unavailable)
- Working CI/CD (out of stock)
- Dana's presence (mystical)
- Committed code (legendary)
- Rational explanations (sold out)
- Pizza (actually, pizza sounds good)
- More snacks (always)

## 🌿 420 MEASURED IN OTHER WAYS

420 minutes equals:
- 25,200 seconds of confusion
- 7 hours of billing
- 1/4 of a Dana (if Dana was real)
- 70 standard "quick fixes"
- 0.29 days of existence
- ∞ amounts of suffering
- 420 individual minutes (whoa)
