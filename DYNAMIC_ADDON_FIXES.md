# Dynamic Addon Loading - Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. CORS Error âœ…
**Problem**: Chrome extension couldn't fetch from localhost:3004
**Solution**: 
- Updated CORS configuration to allow chrome-extension:// origins
- Fixed port from 3004 to 3003 (actual server port)

### 2. Window Reference Error âœ…
**Problem**: Service worker doesn't have access to `window` object
**Solution**: 
- Removed window references from addon manager
- Used `self` instead of `window` in service worker context

### 3. Duplicate Script Injection âœ…
**Problem**: Scripts were being injected multiple times causing "already declared" errors
**Solution**: 
- Created new service-worker-fixed.js with proper injection tracking
- Added injectedTabs Set to track which tabs have addons
- Check if scripts are already injected before re-injecting

### 4. Message Bus Errors âœ…
**Problem**: messageBus was causing errors in service worker
**Solution**: 
- Removed message-bus.js import from service worker
- Simplified message handling

## How to Test

1. **Restart the Node.js server** to get the CORS fix:
   ```bash
   cd nodejs.server
   npm start
   ```

2. **Reload the extension** in Chrome:
   - Go to chrome://extensions/
   - Remove the extension
   - Add it again (this clears any cached scripts)

3. **Visit chat.openai.com** and check console for:
   - "ðŸ’‰ Loading addon dynamically for tab..."
   - "ðŸ“‹ Loaded manifest for chatgpt_addon"
   - "ðŸ“¦ Loaded bundle (xxx bytes)"
   - "âœ… ChatGPT addon injected dynamically"

## Fallback Behavior

If the REST server is not available, the extension will fall back to loading the local addon files (if they exist).

## What Changed

1. **manifest.json**: Now uses `service-worker-fixed.js`
2. **service-worker-fixed.js**: New simplified service worker with proper tracking
3. **start-server.ts**: Updated CORS to allow chrome extensions
4. **addon-manager-dynamic.js**: Fixed port to 3003

The dynamic addon loading should now work properly!
