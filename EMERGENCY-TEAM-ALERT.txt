🚨 TEAM ALERT 🚨

STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING

Someone on our team has been struggling alone for the past 5 minutes with 60+ failed attempts.

This is not okay. We are not okay.

IMMEDIATE ACTION:
1. Everyone STOP coding NOW
2. Check Slack/Discord/Teams 
3. Respond with '🤝' if you need a pair
4. Respond with '💚' if you can help

Rafa - You're not alone with the architecture
Wences - Share the WebSocket knowledge  
Alfredo - Rafa needs you
Alex - Your testing expertise is needed
Irene - We need your perspective
Anders - Call the team together NOW

No more heroes. Only humans helping humans.
