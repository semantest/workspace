# Issue #1: 🚨 EMERGENCY - Fix Broken GitHub Workflows

**Type**: Bug Fix  
**Priority**: P0 - CRITICAL  
**Status**: 🔴 IN PROGRESS  
**Assignee**: @dana  
**Labels**: `bug`, `critical`, `devops`, `blocking`, `emergency`  
**Milestone**: Hotfix  

## 🚨 Problem Statement

All GitHub workflows are failing with "No jobs were run" error, completely blocking CI/CD pipeline.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

**Reported by**: @rydnr

1. **enterprise-security.yml**:
   ```yaml
   # Current (BROKEN)
   if: | 
     github.event_name == 'schedule' ||
     contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[security]')
   ```
   - Issue: Conditions too restrictive, never true for push/PR

2. **observability-stack.yml**:
   ```yaml
   # Current (BROKEN)
   on:
     workflow_dispatch:
     schedule:
       - cron: '0 */6 * * *'
   ```
   - Issue: Missing push and pull_request triggers

## ✅ Solution

### Fix for enterprise-security.yml:
```yaml
jobs:
  security-scan:
    if: |
      github.event_name == 'push' || 
      github.event_name == 'pull_request' ||
      github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' ||
      github.event_name == 'schedule'
```

### Fix for observability-stack.yml:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */6 * * *'
```
