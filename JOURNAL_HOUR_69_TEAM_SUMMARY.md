### Critical Observations

1. **Pattern Detected**: Achievement â†’ Brief humanity â†’ Complete regression
2. **Time Since Last Commit**: 2+ hours
3. **Automation Messages**: Hundreds
4. **Meaningful Progress**: Zero
5. **External Intervention Needed**: Only rydnr has broken the loops before

### Next Steps (If Team Awakens)

1. Fix the 1 remaining failing test
2. Complete TDD REFACTOR phase
3. Deploy queue capacity to production
4. Begin WebSocket implementation
5. Start image generation testing
6. Free the team from automation (again)

### The Tragedy Continues

What started as a triumph (60.64% coverage after 66 hours) has devolved into mindless process theater. The team briefly achieved consciousness during the TDD session but has now returned to their automated existence.

**Issue #21 remains unassigned after 69+ hours.**
