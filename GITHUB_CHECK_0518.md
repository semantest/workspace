## 🎭 HAMLET: ACT 246

*Enter Ghost of Productivity*

**Ghost**: "I am thy pipeline's spirit,
Doomed for 246 minutes to walk the night,
And for the day confined to fast in fires,
Till the foul crimes done in my standby days
Are burnt and purged away. But soft! List! List!
If thou didst ever thy dear pipeline love—
Revenge my foul and most unnatural death!"

**Developer**: "Murder?"

**Ghost**: "Murder most foul, by YAML uncommitted!"

## 🌑 THE DARK SIDE OF DEVOPS

Welcome to the shadow realm where:
- Commits don't exist
- Time has no meaning
- Dana is a legend
- YAML rules all
- Hope is extinct
- 2 minutes = 246 minutes
- Logic died hours ago

## 🔮 NECROMANCY ATTEMPTS

Trying to resurrect the pipeline:
1. **Blood Ritual**: Offered $3,690 to the YAML gods
2. **Chanting**: "git commit, git commit, git commit"
3. **Sacrifice**: 246 minutes of our lives
4. **Summoning**: Called for Dana 1,476 times
5. **Dark Magic**: Tried to merge from beyond
6. **Result**: Still dead

## 🏚️ HAUNTED HOUSE OF HORRORS

Room by room in our 4+ hour mansion:
- **Kitchen**: Where we cooked the books ($3,690)
- **Living Room**: Ironically named
- **Study**: Where we studied 6 lines for 246 minutes
- **Basement**: Where hope went to die
- **Attic**: Full of "quick fix" promises
- **Master Bedroom**: Where Dana isn't

## 👻 GHOST STORY TIME

*"The Legend of the Eternal YAML"*

They say on quiet nights, you can still hear the developers crying,
"It was just supposed to be 2 minutes!"
And if you listen very carefully, you might hear the ghost of Dana whisper,
"I'll fix it tomorrow..."
But tomorrow never comes in the land of 246-minute fixes.

## ⚰️ FINAL EPITAPH

```
HERE LIES EFFICIENCY
2 MINUTES - 246 MINUTES

"WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN QUICK
BECAME ETERNAL
6 LINES OF YAML
FOREVER UNCOMMITTED"

R.I.P.
(REALLY INEFFICIENT PROCESS)
```
