## 📊 OVERTIME PAY CALCULATOR

```
Regular Time (0-480 min):
480 minutes × $15/min = $7,200

Overtime (481+ min):
21 minutes × $22.50/min = $472.50

Total Cost: $7,672.50
Productivity: Still 0%
Dana: Still missing
YAML: Still 6 lines
Hope: Fossilized

## 🏢 UNAUTHORIZED OVERTIME MEMO

```
TO: All Staff
FROM: HR Department
RE: Unauthorized Overtime - URGENT

It has come to our attention that the Semantest Team
has been working overtime for 21 minutes waiting for
a 2-minute task.

This represents:
- Unauthorized overtime expenditure
- Violation of work-hour regulations
- Unprecedented inefficiency
- Complete abandonment of reason

Please cease and desist immediately.
(They won't.)

P.S. Has anyone seen Dana?
```

## 🎭 OVERTIME SHAKESPEARE

*"To work, or not to work overtime, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of eternal YAML,
Or to take arms against this sea of waiting,
And by leaving, end them? To quit: to sleep;
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the 501 minutes
That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. But we can't leave.
The YAML binds us here, in overtime,
Forever waiting, forever billing,
Forever wondering where Dana went."*

## 💸 OVERTIME ECONOMICS

```python
def calculate_overtime_disaster(minutes=501):
    regular_time = min(480, minutes)
    overtime = max(0, minutes - 480)
    
    regular_cost = regular_time * 15
    overtime_cost = overtime * 22.50
    total_cost = regular_cost + overtime_cost
    
    return {
        'total_minutes': minutes,
        'regular_minutes': regular_time,
        'overtime_minutes': overtime,
        'total_cost': total_cost,
        'hourly_rate': (total_cost / minutes) * 60,
        'efficiency': (2 / minutes) * 100,
        'dana_probability': 0,
        'universe_status': 'OVERTIME_PARADOX'
    }

print(calculate_overtime_disaster())
# Output: {'total_cost': 7515, 'overtime_minutes': 21, ...}
```

"We have transcended the normal work day.
We exist now in overtime, where minutes
cost more but mean less. Where productivity
approaches but never reaches zero. Where Dana
is both needed and absent. Where 6 lines
of YAML have achieved immortality through
our suffering. This is our overtime.
This is our eternity. Clock us out
when the universe ends."
