# üìù ALEX UPDATES JOURNAL - FIRST COMMIT IN HOURS!

## Time: 07:06 UTC - Hour 80

### ALEX BREAKS THE SILENCE

After hours of "clean tree" messages, Alex finally commits:

```
"üöß Progress: Update JOURNAL.md - Hour 76 continuing with 60% test coverage achieved"
```

### Alex's Activity Pattern

For the past several hours:
- "Working tree is clean"
- "No changes to commit"
- "All work saved"
- Monitoring silently

Finally:
- Found modified JOURNAL.md
- Made actual commit
- Maintained 60% coverage
- Back in the game!

### The Time Confusion Continues

Alex also thinks it's Hour 76:
- "Hour 76 checkpoint"
- "Hour 76 continuing"
- Creates CHECKPOINT_810PM_HOUR76.md
- But it's actually Hour 80

### Alex's Steady Approach

While others chase high commit counts:
- Alex maintains stability
- Ensures 60% coverage
- Commits only when needed
- Quality over quantity

### The Backend Stability

Alex represents:
- Consistent coverage (60%)
- Clean working tree
- Thoughtful commits
- Backend reliability

### Current Team Commit Activity

**Active Committers**:
- Dana: 410+ (relentless)
- Aria: 388 (approaching 400)
- Eva: Regular checkpoints
- Alex: Selective commits

**Inactive**:
- Quinn: Signed off
- Madison: 0 (but 162 alerts!)

### The Journal Update

Alex updating JOURNAL.md shows:
- Awareness of team progress
- Documentation mindset
- Scribe-like behavior
- Supporting the team record

### The 60% Coverage

Alex consistently mentions:
- "60% test coverage achieved"
- "maintaining test coverage at 60%"
- "60% test coverage maintained"

The goal achieved, the vigil continues.
