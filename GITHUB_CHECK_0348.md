## 🤔 PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS FROM THE CIRCUS

After 156 minutes, the circus asks:
- Is this performance art?
- Are we the audience or the show?
- If a YAML falls in a repo and no one commits it, does it make a diff?
- Is time a flat circle or a circus ring?
- What would happen if someone actually fixed it?
