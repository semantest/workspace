## Phase 9: Google Images Download Implementation (2025-01-17)

### Overview
This phase introduces the Google Images download functionality to the Semantest ecosystem, enabling automated high-resolution image downloads from Google Images search results. The implementation follows the event-driven architecture established in previous phases and integrates seamlessly with the existing framework.

### Technical Achievements

- **Browser MCP Integration**: Created `browser/src/google-images-downloader.ts` with Google Images downloader class
- **Chrome Extension Domain Entity**: Implemented `GoogleImagesDownloader` entity with sophisticated URL resolution
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Full event flow from download request to completion with correlation tracking
- **TypeScript-EDA Foundation**: Leveraged existing Entity and Event abstractions for consistency

#### Key Features Implemented
1. **Intelligent URL Resolution**
   - Multiple fallback strategies for extracting high-resolution URLs
   - Google Images thumbnail detection and resolution
   - Direct image URL validation
   - Simulated click interaction for full-resolution loading

2. **Pattern Learning System**

- Caching of download history and learned patterns
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection

### Technical Challenges Overcome

1. **Google Images URL Complexity**
   - Thumbnails use encrypted URLs requiring resolution
   - Multiple URL encoding schemes across different image types
   - Dynamic loading requiring DOM observation

2. **Cross-Origin Restrictions**
   - Chrome extension manifest permissions carefully configured
   - Content script injection for Google Images pages
   - Secure message passing between contexts

3. **Performance Optimization**

export abstract class Entity<T = any> {
    private _domainEvents: DomainEvent[] = [];
    
    protected addDomainEvent(event: DomainEvent): void {
        this._domainEvents.push(event);
    }
    
    abstract getId(): string;
}

export abstract class AggregateRoot<T = any> extends Entity<T> {
    protected applyEvent(event: DomainEvent): void {
        this.addDomainEvent(event);
