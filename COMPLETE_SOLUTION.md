# Complete Solution - Dynamic Addon Loading

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working
1. Dynamic addon loading from REST server
2. Addon is successfully injected into ChatGPT
3. Bridge communication is active
4. Extension shows "Active Addon: ChatGPT"
5. Service worker handles WebSocket messages

### ‚ùå What's Not Working
1. WebSocket server doesn't forward image events to extension
2. "No active tab" error when testing

## Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Ensure Setup
1. Addon server running: `cd nodejs.server && ./run-addon-server.sh`
2. WebSocket server running: `cd nodejs.server && npm start`
3. Extension reloaded in Chrome
4. ChatGPT tab open: https://chat.openai.com

### Step 2: Direct Test (Bypass WebSocket)
1. Open service worker console (chrome://extensions/ ‚Üí click "service worker")
2. Copy ALL contents from `test-chatgpt-direct.js`
3. Paste in console and press Enter
4. You should see:
   - List of ChatGPT tabs
   - ‚úÖ Bridge is active
   - ‚úÖ Addon response
5. Check ChatGPT tab - the prompt should appear!

### Step 3: Fix WebSocket Forwarding
The WebSocket server needs to forward events. It currently shows "Unknown event type" because it's not configured to broadcast `semantest/custom/image/download/requested` events to extension clients.

## Quick Workaround Script

Create this script to test without WebSocket:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# direct-test.sh - Test addon without WebSocket server

echo "Direct addon test - bypassing WebSocket"
echo "1. Make sure ChatGPT tab is open"
echo "2. Open service worker console"
echo "3. Paste the test code from test-chatgpt-direct.js"
echo ""
echo "This will send the image request directly to the addon"
```

## What Needs Fixing

The WebSocket server (running on port 3004) needs to:
1. Recognize `semantest/custom/image/download/requested` events
2. Broadcast them to connected extension clients
3. Not just log "Unknown event type"

## Success Criteria

When everything works:
1. Run: `./generate-image-async.sh "test prompt"`
2. Service worker shows: "üéØ Image download request detected!"
3. ChatGPT tab shows the prompt being typed
4. Image generation starts

## Current Workaround

Use the direct test (`test-chatgpt-direct.js`) to verify the addon works. This proves:
- Addon is loaded ‚úÖ
- Bridge works ‚úÖ
- Image generation can be triggered ‚úÖ

Only the WebSocket forwarding needs to be fixed for the full flow to work.
