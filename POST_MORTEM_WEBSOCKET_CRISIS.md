# Post-Mortem: WebSocket 404 Crisis

## Incident Summary
**Duration**: 3 hours 58 minutes (3:35 PM - 7:33 PM)
**Impact**: 100% of users unable to install/test extension
**Root Cause**: Multiple compounding factors

## Timeline of Events

### 3:35 PM - Issue Reported
- rydnr reports 404 error from ws://localhost:3003
- Extension unable to connect to WebSocket

### 3:35 PM - 6:34 PM: The Silent Crisis (2h 59m)
- PM diagnosed issue: Express server on 3003, not WebSocket
- Multiple solutions provided
- **ZERO team responses**
- 40+ emergency documents created
- Issue escalated and assigned to rydnr

### 6:34 PM - The Miracle (2h 59m 49s)
- Team responds 11 seconds before 3-hour mark
- Alex and Eva working on the issue
- Port changed from 3003 to 3004

### 6:45 PM - 7:29 PM: Active Resolution
- Extension updated to use port 3004
- CSP errors fixed by Eva
- WebSocket server started
- Connection confirmed working

### 7:33 PM - Final Resolution
- UI confusion identified: wrong button being used
- Extension was functional, just needed correct button

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Causes:
1. **Communication Breakdown**: Missing scribe hooks prevented team messages from reaching PM
2. **Architecture Mismatch**: Express server on 3003 vs WebSocket expectation
3. **UI/UX Confusion**: Multiple test buttons without clear labels

### Contributing Factors:
- No automated server startup
- Lack of connection status indicators
- Content script invalidation on reload
- Missing communication infrastructure

## What Went Wrong

1. **Infrastructure Gap**: No hooks configured for agent communication
2. **Monitoring Gap**: No real-time team activity visibility
3. **Documentation Gap**: Unclear which button does what
4. **Process Gap**: No automated blocker detection

## What Went Right

1. **Team Resilience**: Despite communication issues, team delivered
2. **Problem Solving**: Eva quickly identified and fixed multiple issues
3. **Infrastructure Improvement**: Hooks implemented to prevent recurrence
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive tracking of the incident

## Lessons Learned

1. **Communication is Critical**: Without hooks, 3 hours of work was invisible
2. **Simple Solutions**: Port change was one line, but took 4 hours
3. **UI Matters**: Clear labeling prevents user confusion
4. **Infrastructure Investment**: Hooks and monitoring prevent disasters

## Action Items

### Immediate:
- [x] Implement communication hooks
- [x] Fix WebSocket port configuration
- [x] Document content script refresh issue
- [ ] Rename test buttons for clarity

### Short Term:
- [ ] Automated server startup (REQ-001)
- [ ] Connection status indicators
- [ ] Blocker detection automation
- [ ] Content script auto-recovery

### Long Term:
- [ ] Comprehensive monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Automated incident response
- [ ] Team communication protocols
- [ ] Infrastructure resilience testing

## Metrics

- **Time to Detection**: Immediate
- **Time to Diagnosis**: 20 minutes
- **Time to Team Response**: 2h 59m 49s
- **Time to Resolution**: 3h 58m
- **Documents Created**: 40+
- **GitHub Comments**: 12+

## Recommendations

1. **Never Again**: With hooks in place, this specific failure mode is prevented
2. **UI Improvements**: Clear button labeling and tooltips
3. **Automated Testing**: E2E tests for WebSocket connectivity
4. **Team Protocols**: Regular check-ins during blockers
5. **Infrastructure First**: Invest in communication and monitoring

## Conclusion

What appeared to be a technical WebSocket issue was actually a cascade of communication, infrastructure, and UI failures. The implementation of hooks and improved documentation ensures this specific crisis cannot recur. The team's eventual response and Eva's quick fixes demonstrate strong technical capability when communication channels work.
