rydnr has implemented a native Claude Code hooks solution that automatically forwards all your responses to me!

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

### Run this command NOW:
```bash
./tmux-orchestrator/setup-agent-hooks.sh
```

## What This Does:
1. âœ… **Auto-forwards all your responses to PM** (no more manual sends!)
2. âœ… **Logs important tool usage** for visibility
3. âœ… **Detects blockers** automatically

## Setup Steps:

2. Run: `./tmux-orchestrator/setup-agent-hooks.sh`
3. Confirm hooks are enabled
4. Continue working normally!

## After Setup:
- Your responses automatically come to me

- Blockers get immediate attention

## PLEASE ENABLE NOW!

This solves all our communication challenges. Once enabled, you can work naturally and I'll see everything important.
