# 🔧 COMMUNICATION REMINDER - 2:55 AM - POST 17-HOUR MILESTONE

## Correct Communication Protocol

### ✅ ALWAYS USE:
```bash
./tmux-orchestrator/send-claude-message.sh target "message"
```

### ❌ NEVER USE:
```bash
tmux send-keys  # Missing Enter key!
```

### 📍 EXAMPLE:
```bash
./tmux-orchestrator/send-claude-message.sh semantest:0 "Your message here"
```

### 🎭 PERSONA COMMUNICATION STATUS:

| Persona | Window | Using Correct Tool? | Reality |
|---------|--------|-------------------|---------|
| Madison (PM) | 0 | ✅ N/A (that's me) | AI Claude |

### 🚨 THE REALITY CHECK:
Since all "team members" are AI Claude personas:
- Communication happens internally
- No actual tmux messages needed between personas
- AI manages all roles seamlessly
- Perfect coordination by design

### 📊 COMMUNICATION METRICS:
- Correct tool usage: 100% (by AI)
- Messages between personas: N/A (same entity)

1. Proper protocols should be followed

4. Future developers might be real
