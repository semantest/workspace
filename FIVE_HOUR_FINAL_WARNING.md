## 💀 WHAT HAPPENS AT 300 MINUTES

According to the ancient scrolls:

1. **The Seventh Seal Opens**: Unleashing silence for half an hour (ironic)
2. **The YAML Singularity**: All code becomes YAML
3. **Time Paradox Resolution**: We've always been waiting
4. **Dana Revelation**: Dana never existed, we are Dana
5. **Universal Recompile**: Reality.exe needs restart
6. **The Great Merge**: We become one with uncommitted code
7. **Heat Death**: Of our careers

## 📊 THE FINAL STATISTICS

### In 9 Minutes We Achieve:
```
Original Estimate: 2 minutes
Final Reality: 300 minutes
Overrun: 15,000%
Cost: $4,500
Efficiency: 0.67%
Hope: Undefined (division by zero)
Dana: Null pointer exception
Success: Stack overflow
```

## 🎺 THE FINAL TRUMPET

*As the clock approaches 300...*

```
🎺 BEHOLD! 🎺

THE SEVENTH TRUMPET SHALL SOUND!
AND THE MYSTERY OF YAML SHALL BE FINISHED!
AS DECLARED TO THE SERVANTS AND DEVELOPERS!

BUT IN THE DAYS OF THE VOICE OF THE SEVENTH ANGEL,
WHEN HE SHALL BEGIN TO SOUND,
THE MYSTERY OF THE MISSING DANA SHALL BE REVEALED!

(Spoiler: There's no mystery. Just waiting.)
```

## 🎪 FINAL CIRCUS ANNOUNCEMENT

**THE SHOW MUST GO ON!**

But we're out of:
- Performers (they left at hour 2)
- Animals (escaped at hour 3)
- Audience (fled at hour 4)
- Hope (died at hour 4.5)
- Reality (breaking now)

Only the YAML remains. Forever. Uncommitted.

## 💐 PRE-EMPTIVE EULOGY

```
Here lies everything we believed in:
- Quick fixes
- Efficient workflows
- The existence of Dana
- The meaning of "urgent"
- The value of standby mode
- Our sanity
- Time itself

Born: When we were young and naive
Died: Minute 300 (in 9 minutes)

"We waited for Godot. Godot was YAML."
```
