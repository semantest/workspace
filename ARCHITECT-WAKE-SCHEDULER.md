# 🏗️ Architect Wake Scheduler System

## Overview
Automated architectural review system that analyzes and improves system design every 30 minutes using SuperClaude's --ultrathink capability.

## Schedule
- **Frequency**: Every 30 minutes
- **First Review**: Already dispatched!
- **Analysis Depth**: --ultrathink (32K tokens)

## Review Process

### 1. System Architecture Analysis
- Current architecture assessment
- Pattern recognition and anti-patterns
- Coupling and cohesion metrics
- Dependency analysis

### 2. Quality Dimensions
- **Scalability**: Can the system handle 10x growth?
- **Security**: Vulnerability assessment and threat modeling
- **Performance**: Bottleneck identification and optimization
- **Maintainability**: Technical debt quantification

### 3. Output Generation

```

### 4. Roadmap Integration
- Automatic roadmap updates
- Priority scoring (P0-P3)
- Effort estimation
- Dependency mapping

## Benefits
1. **Proactive Debt Prevention**: Catch issues before they compound
2. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular architectural evolution
3. **Evidence-Based Decisions**: Data-driven recommendations
4. **Automated Documentation**: Self-documenting architecture

## Integration with Other Systems
- **Agent Reflection Scheduler**: Share insights on team pain points
- **Tmux Orchestrator 2.0**: Coordinate architectural improvements
- **Wave Orchestration**: Complex refactoring campaigns

## Metrics Tracked
- Technical debt ratio
- Coupling metrics
- Security vulnerability count
- Performance regression trends
- Scalability readiness score

## Example Output
```markdown
# REQ-001-WEBSOCKET-OPTIMIZATION
Generated: 2025-07-25 | Architect Review #1

## Analysis
WebSocket implementation shows good progress but lacks:
- Connection pooling for multiple clients
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Message queuing during disconnections

## Recommendations
1. Implement connection pool (P1, 2 days)
2. Add message persistence layer (P2, 3 days)
3. Create health check endpoint (P1, 1 day)

## Roadmap Update
Add to v1.1.0 milestone: WebSocket reliability improvements
