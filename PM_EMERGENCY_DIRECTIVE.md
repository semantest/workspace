# üö® PM EMERGENCY DIRECTIVE - EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY

## QA Crisis Response - Option A APPROVED for ALL 5 Decisions

Given the critical modules at risk (google.com: 2%, nodejs.server: 5%, sdk: 8%) and Eva's WebSocket bug proving the danger, I'm implementing QA's recommended Option A across the board.

## EMERGENCY DIRECTIVES - EFFECTIVE NOW:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Developer Allocation - IMMEDIATE**
- **Alex**: STOP current work, write WebSocket integration tests NOW
- **Dana**: PAUSE shell script, setup CI/CD gates IMMEDIATELY
- **Eva**: ADD tests for the port fix that just saved us
- **Sam**: DOCUMENT test requirements for each module

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **No-Merge Policy - STARTING NOW**
- **HARD STOP**: No code merges without tests
- **Minimum**: 2 tests per feature/fix
- **Reviews**: Must verify test coverage
- **NO EXCEPTIONS** (even hotfixes need tests)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **3-Month Timeline - ACCEPTED**
- **Week 1-2**: Critical modules (WebSocket, SDK)
- **Month 1**: 30% coverage milestone
- **Month 2**: 60% coverage milestone
- **Month 3**: 80% coverage achieved

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **2-Week Test Sprint - STARTING MONDAY**
- **FULL STOP** on new features
- **ALL HANDS** on test writing
- **Daily Goals**: 5% coverage increase
- **Focus Areas**: google.com (2%), nodejs.server (5%), sdk (8%)

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **CI/CD Gates - IMPLEMENT TODAY**
- **Dana**: GitHub Actions with coverage gates
- **Initial Gate**: 15% (must achieve by EOD)
- **Weekly Increases**: +10% each week
- **Merge Blocking**: Automatic enforcement

## CRITICAL PATH MODULES (Priority Order):

1. **WebSocket/SDK** (8% ‚Üí 50% in 1 week)
   - Eva's bug showed this vulnerability
   - Integration tests for all events
   - Port configuration tests

2. **nodejs.server** (5% ‚Üí 40% in 1 week)
   - Server stability critical
   - API endpoint tests
   - Error handling coverage

3. **google.com** (2% ‚Üí 30% in 1 week)
   - Image download functionality
   - Authentication tests
   - State management tests

## TODAY'S MANDATORY ACTIONS:

### By 12:00 PM:
- Dana: CI/CD pipeline live with 15% gate
- All devs: Submit first test PR

### By 3:00 PM:
- Coverage report showing progress
- Test templates created for each module

### By 5:00 PM:
- 15% total coverage achieved
- Plan for tomorrow's test targets

## NO NEGOTIATION ITEMS:
- Tests are now MANDATORY
- Coverage gates WILL block merges
- Feature work is SECONDARY to tests
- This is about PROJECT SURVIVAL

## Message to Team:

"The 9.8% coverage with critical modules at 2-8% is a CODE RED situation. Eva's WebSocket bug detection proves we're flying blind. Option A is now in effect - aggressive but necessary. This is not a drill. Every line of untested code is a production bug waiting to happen. We fix this NOW or we fail later. No exceptions, no excuses. Let's save this project together."

## Accountability:
- Hourly coverage reports to PM
- Daily standup focused on test metrics
- Weekly coverage reviews with consequences

**This crisis ends when we hit 80% coverage. Not before.**
