# Architecture Status - 3:50 AM

## Current State
- Extended session continuing (5hr 50min)
- Monitoring for architecture questions
- Team dealing with TypeScript blocker

## Recent Architecture Work
- Reviewed Quinn's comprehensive test plan
- Prioritized failover integration tests as highest risk
- Documented test strategy recommendations
- Collaborated with Sam on GitHub Pages documentation

## Key Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Hybrid WebSocket + REST architecture** - Best of both worlds
2. **Priority queue with retry logic** - Reliable image processing
3. **Local/cloud failover strategy** - High availability
4. **Modular addon system** - Extensibility and isolation

## Ready to Support
- TypeScript configuration issues
- Test architecture questions
- Integration patterns
- Any design clarifications needed

## Next Actions
- Continue monitoring for team questions
- Support TypeScript resolution if needed
- Maintain architecture documentation
