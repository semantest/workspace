# üîÑ WORKFLOW UPDATE - 22:45 UTC - MANIFEST CHANGE! ‚ö†Ô∏è

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CONFIGURATION CHANGE DETECTED

## 1) TEAM STATUS: MONITORING üëÄ
- **Alert Level**: ELEVATED
- **Response**: Immediate guidance ready
- **Concern**: Could impact testing

## 2) CHANGE DETECTED: SERVICE WORKER PATH
```diff
- "service_worker": "service-worker.js"
+ "service_worker": "background.js"
```

## 3) USER ACTION MAY BE REQUIRED! üîÑ

### If loading from `/extension.chrome/build/`:
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find the extension
3. Click refresh button (‚Üª)
4. Check for errors

### Important Notes:
- This is in the BUILD directory manifest
- Main manifest uses: `src/background/service-worker.js`
- User might be loading from build/ directory

## POTENTIAL IMPACT:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If user loaded from build/, extension needs reload
- ‚ö†Ô∏è background.js uses ES6 modules (previous issue)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May cause service worker errors again

## QUICK FIX IF ISSUES:
```bash
# If errors appear, remind user:
# Load from: /home/chous/work/semantest/extension.chrome/
# NOT from: /home/chous/work/semantest/extension.chrome/build/
```

## MONITORING STATUS:
```
Change Type:    CONFIGURATION
Risk Level:     MEDIUM
Action Needed:  RELOAD IF USING BUILD/
Team Ready:     YES
```
