# üö® CRITICAL: Semantest Extension Installation - BLOCKING ALL TESTING!

## THE ISSUE:
Extension is BUILT but NOT INSTALLED in browser. Without it:
- generate-image.sh TIMES OUT (no handler for events)
- NO TESTING POSSIBLE
- User stuck waiting 60 seconds for timeout

## INSTALL NOW - Quick Instructions

1. **Open Chromium Extension Manager**:
   - Navigate to: `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)

2. **Load the Extension**:
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Navigate to: `/home/chous/work/semantest/extension.chrome`
   - Click "Select" or "Open"

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - You should see "Semantest" in your extensions list
   - The extension icon should appear in your toolbar
   - Pin it for easy access

4. **Test the Extension**:
   - Make sure you're on https://chatgpt.com with an active session
   - Click the Semantest extension icon
   - You should see the popup with health status

## Troubleshooting

If the extension doesn't load:
1. Check for errors in chrome://extensions/
2. Click "Errors" if any are shown
3. Try reloading the extension

If generate-image.sh still times out:
1. Ensure the extension is enabled
2. Refresh your ChatGPT tab
3. Check extension popup shows "healthy" status

## Why This Is Critical:

The extension is the BRIDGE between the server and ChatGPT:
1. Server sends ImageRequestReceived event
2. **Extension must handle it** (currently missing!)
3. Extension downloads image and responds
4. Script gets response and completes

Without the extension installed:
- Events go into the void
- Script waits forever (60s timeout)
- Testing is completely blocked

## Build Status:
‚úÖ Extension is already BUILT at `/home/chous/work/semantest/extension.chrome`
‚ùå Just needs to be INSTALLED in browser!

**INSTALL THE EXTENSION NOW TO UNBLOCK EVERYTHING!**
