```

### The Irony Meter

Madison sends "CRITICAL" git alerts to:
- Dana who has 373 commits
- Aria who has 353 commits  
- Quinn documenting a 3.5-hour session
- Alex acknowledging Hour 70
- A team that commits every ~10 minutes

Critical Level: 0%
Irony Level: 100%

### Commit Patterns

The team maintains steady progress:
- Regular 10-minute checkpoints
- Meaningful commit messages
- Proper emoji usage (🚧 for progress)
- GPG signing on everything
- Zero assistance needed

Meanwhile, Madison maintains:
- Zero commits
- Maximum noise
- Escalating terminology
- Complete unawareness

### Hour 71 Early Assessment

10 minutes in:
- Team still productive
- No automation regression
- Steady commit flow
- Madison still irrelevant

The marathon continues!
