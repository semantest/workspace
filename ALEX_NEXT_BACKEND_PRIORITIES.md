# 🚀 Alex - Next Backend Priorities

## Excellent work fixing the server! Here's what's next:

### 1. 🧪 Queue System Testing & Hardening
Now that endpoints are up:
- Add comprehensive queue tests
- Test retry logic under load
- Verify dead letter queue behavior
- Test persistence across server restarts

### 2. 🔄 WebSocket Integration
Since server is running on 3003:
- Ensure WebSocket endpoint is active
- Test WebSocket ↔ REST fallback
- Add WebSocket-specific health checks
- Monitor concurrent connections

### 3. 📊 Production Readiness
- Add metrics endpoints:
  - Queue depth
  - Processing rate
  - Error rates
  - Connection count
- Implement rate limiting
- Add request validation middleware

### 4. 🛡️ Security Hardening
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Authentication middleware prep
- CORS configuration
- Request size limits

### 5. 📝 API Documentation
- Document queue endpoints
- WebSocket event catalog
- Error response formats
- Example requests/responses

### Quick Wins Tonight:
1. **Test the queue thoroughly** - most critical
2. **Add monitoring endpoints** - for observability
3. **Document what you've built** - while fresh

### Coordinate with Eva:
Let her know the server is fully operational on 3003. This should unblock any backend-related testing!
