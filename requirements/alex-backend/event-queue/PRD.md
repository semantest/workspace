# Product Requirements Document: In-Memory Event Queue

## Overview
Implement a high-performance in-memory event queue system to handle real-time browser events, test execution tracking, and usage analytics for the Semantest SaaS platform.

## Goals
- Handle high-volume browser events efficiently
- Enable real-time test execution monitoring
- Provide foundation for usage analytics
- Support horizontal scaling
- Maintain event ordering guarantees

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Event Types**
   - Browser actions (click, type, navigate)
   - Test execution status updates
   - Error and exception events
   - Performance metrics
   - User session events

2. **Queue Operations**
   - Enqueue with <10ms latency
   - Batch dequeue support
   - Priority queue for critical events
   - Dead letter queue for failures
   - Event replay capability

3. **Processing Pipeline**
   - Event validation and enrichment
   - Routing to appropriate handlers
   - Aggregation for analytics
   - Real-time streaming to dashboards
   - Persistence to storage

### Technical Requirements
- In-memory storage with Redis/Hazelcast
- Pub/sub for real-time updates
- Horizontal scaling support
- At-least-once delivery guarantee
- Circuit breaker for downstream services

### Performance Requirements
- 10,000+ events/second throughput
- <10ms p99 latency
- <100MB memory per 100K events
- Auto-scaling based on queue depth
- Graceful degradation under load

## Success Criteria
- Queue handles load testing successfully
- Zero event loss under normal operation
- Dashboard receives real-time updates
- Monitoring and alerting in place
- Documentation and examples complete

## Timeline
- Queue implementation: 2 days
- Event handlers: 1 day
- Dashboard integration: 1 day
- Testing and optimization: 1 day
