# REQ-003: Roadmap Updates for Agent Access Architecture

## Milestone Impact

### v1.0.3 - URGENT HOTFIX
**Timeline**: Immediate
**Additions**:
- âœ… Create fix-agent-access.sh
- âœ… Document discovery in REQ-003
- ðŸš§ Test workspace restructuring
- ðŸš§ Update agent launch procedures

### v1.1.0 - Architecture Enhancement
**Timeline**: Next Week
**Additions**:
- Standardized workspace structure
- Tool distribution system
- Agent access configuration
- Multi-project orchestration support

### v2.0.0 - Tmux Orchestrator Integration
**Timeline**: Next Month
**Additions**:
- Native workspace management
- Automatic tool distribution
- Permission validation system
- Cross-project agent communication

## Technical Debt Addressed
- **57+ Hour Communication Issue**: RESOLVED
- **Multi-Agent Scaling**: UNBLOCKED
- **Tool Accessibility**: FIXED
- **Project Isolation**: SOLVED

## New Capabilities Enabled
1. **True Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Agents can finally communicate
2. **Cross-Project Collaboration**: Shared tool access
3. **Scalable Architecture**: No more per-project tool copying
4. **Reduced Setup Time**: From hours to minutes

## Dependencies
- Tmux Orchestrator 2.0 must incorporate workspace management
- All existing agents need migration
- Documentation update required
- Training for team on new structure

## Risk Mitigation
- Backward compatibility with existing setups
- Gradual migration path
- Extensive testing before v1.1.0
- Rollback procedures documented

## The Silver Lining
After 599 workflow checks, we discovered the root cause of our suffering. 
This discovery transforms our architecture from:
- "Why can't agents communicate?" 
- To: "Here's how we enable seamless multi-agent systems!"
