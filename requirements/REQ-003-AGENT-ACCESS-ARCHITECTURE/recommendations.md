# REQ-003: Recommendations for Agent Access Architecture

## Priority: P0 - CRITICAL (Blocking all multi-agent operations)

## Recommended Solutions

### 1. Standardized Workspace Structure (RECOMMENDED)
```
/workspace/
├── shared-tools/          ← Common tools here
│   ├── message-agent.sh
│   ├── orchestrator.sh
│   └── utilities/
├── projects/
│   ├── semantest/        ← Launch agents from /workspace/
│   ├── another-project/
│   └── project-n/
└── agent-workspaces/     ← Dedicated agent work areas
```

### 2. Symbolic Link Strategy
```bash
# In each project
ln -s ../../shared-tools/message-agent.sh ./tools/message-agent.sh
```
**Pros**: Simple, maintains existing structure
**Cons**: Links might not work in all environments

### 3. Agent Launch Configuration
```bash
# Launch agents from parent directory
cd /home/chous/work
./spawn-agent.sh --workdir semantest --access-parent
```

### 4. Tool Distribution System
- Automated script copying during project init
- Version control for distributed tools
- Update mechanism for all projects

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate (Today)
1. Create fix-agent-access.sh script ✓
2. Document in AGENT-ACCESS-ARCHITECTURE.md ✓
3. Test with current agents

### Phase 2: Short-term (This Week)
1. Standardize workspace structure
2. Update all agent launch scripts
3. Create migration guide

### Phase 3: Long-term (Next Sprint)
1. Implement tool distribution system
2. Add to Tmux Orchestrator 2.0
3. Create automated tests

## Success Metrics
- Agents can access all required tools
- No more "message-agent.sh not found"
- Multi-project orchestration works
- 0 hours wasted on permission issues
