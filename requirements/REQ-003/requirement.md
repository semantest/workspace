# REQ-003: Production-Scale Architecture Enhancements

**ID**: REQ-003  
**Date**: 2025-07-22  
**Status**: DRAFT  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Requester**: Architecture Review System  

## Overview
Following the success of v1.0.2 and Carol's bulk generation system, we need architectural enhancements to support production-scale operations (2000-3000 images) for graphic novel generation.

## Problem Statement
Current architecture faces critical limitations when scaling to thousands of images:
1. Service workers terminate after 30 seconds of inactivity
2. Memory exhaustion risk with large batches
3. Single-threaded processing bottleneck
4. Limited state persistence for multi-hour operations

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **FR-001**: System MUST handle 3000 images without service worker termination
2. **FR-002**: System MUST manage memory efficiently, preventing crashes
3. **FR-003**: System MUST support parallel processing across multiple tabs
4. **FR-004**: System MUST persist complete state for recovery from any failure
5. **FR-005**: System MUST provide real-time progress monitoring
6. **FR-006**: System MUST maintain style consistency across all images

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **NFR-001**: Processing rate MUST exceed 10 images per minute
2. **NFR-002**: Memory usage MUST stay below 80% of available
3. **NFR-003**: System MUST recover from failures within 30 seconds
4. **NFR-004**: Success rate MUST exceed 95% for production batches
5. **NFR-005**: Architecture MUST support future scaling to 10,000+ images

## Success Criteria
- Successfully generate 3000 images in a single operation
- Zero data loss from service worker termination
- Memory usage remains stable throughout operation
- Parallel processing reduces total time by 70%
- Complete recovery from any failure point

## Constraints
- Chrome Manifest V3 limitations
- ChatGPT API rate limits
- Browser memory constraints
- Service worker lifecycle restrictions

## Dependencies
- REQ-001: Basic image generation (COMPLETE)
- REQ-002: Bulk generation system (COMPLETE)
- Carol's checkpoint recovery system

## Risks
- Service worker termination could lose hours of work
- Memory exhaustion could crash the browser
- Rate limits could extend processing time significantly
- Complex state management could introduce bugs

## User Impact
Enables graphic novel creators to generate thousands of images reliably, transforming days of manual work into hours of automated generation.
