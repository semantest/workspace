# Product Requirements Document: Infrastructure as Code Deployments

## Overview
Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for Semantest cloud deployments using modern tools to ensure reproducible, scalable infrastructure across Azure and AWS.

## Goals
- Define all infrastructure as code
- Enable one-click deployments
- Support multi-cloud (Azure + AWS)
- Implement cost optimization
- Ensure security best practices

## Requirements

### Infrastructure Components
1. **API Backend**
   - Container orchestration (K8s/ECS)
   - Auto-scaling groups
   - Load balancers
   - SSL/TLS termination

2. **Database Layer**
   - Managed PostgreSQL/MySQL
   - Read replicas
   - Automated backups
   - Connection pooling

3. **Storage**
   - Object storage for addons
   - CDN for static assets
   - Backup storage
   - Log storage

4. **Networking**
   - VPC/VNet configuration
   - Security groups
   - Private subnets
   - NAT gateways

### IaC Tool Requirements
- Terraform or Pulumi for provisioning
- Version controlled configs
- State management
- Module reusability
- Environment separation (dev/staging/prod)

### Security Requirements
- Secrets management (Vault/KMS)
- IAM roles and policies
- Network isolation
- Encryption at rest/transit
- Compliance scanning

### Operational Requirements
- Monitoring and alerting
- Log aggregation
- Backup automation
- Disaster recovery
- Cost tracking

## Success Criteria
- Infrastructure deployed successfully
- Zero manual configuration required
- Security audit passing
- Cost optimization achieved
- Documentation complete

## Timeline
- IaC setup: 1 day
- Azure deployment: 2 days
- AWS deployment: 2 days
- Testing and optimization: 1 day
