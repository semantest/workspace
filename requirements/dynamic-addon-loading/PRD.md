# Product Requirements Document: Dynamic Addon Loading System

## Overview
Implement a system to dynamically load and cache addons based on the domain of the current browser tab, following a "walking skeleton" approach with progressive enhancement.

## Background
Currently, addons are bundled with the extension. We need to move to a dynamic loading system where addons are fetched from a REST API based on the domain, enabling scalability and easier addon management.

## Goals
- Decouple addon storage from the extension
- Enable domain-based addon loading
- Implement caching for performance
- Use Domain-Driven Design for repository abstraction
- Support both in-memory (local) and cloud-based storage

## Implementation Phases (Walking Skeleton Approach)

### Phase 1: Basic Loading
- Remove addon from extension bundle
- Create REST endpoint that receives domain parameter
- Return addon without domain validation
- Verify extension can load external addon

### Phase 2: Domain Validation
- Add metadata to addons (supported domains, version, etc.)
- Implement domain matching logic
- Return appropriate addon based on domain
- Handle domain mismatches gracefully

### Phase 3: Repository Pattern
- Implement DDD repository abstraction
- Create in-memory implementation for local development
- Design interface for cloud storage (future)
- Add caching layer

## Technical Requirements

### API Endpoints
```
GET /api/addons/:domain
Response: {
  id: string,
  domain: string,
  version: string,
  script: string,
  metadata: {
    name: string,
    description: string,
    supportedDomains: string[],
    lastUpdated: timestamp
  }
}
```

### Extension Changes (Eva)
- Remove bundled addons
- Implement addon fetching logic
- Add caching mechanism
- Handle loading states and errors

### Backend Implementation (Alex)
- REST API with Express/Fastify
- Repository pattern implementation
- In-memory storage adapter
- Domain validation logic

### Architecture Coordination (Aria)
- Define repository interfaces
- Ensure DDD principles
- Plan for cloud migration
- Coordinate implementation between teams

## Success Criteria
- Extension successfully loads addons from API
- <100ms loading time for cached addons
- <500ms for fresh addon fetch
- Zero errors in production
- Clean separation of concerns via DDD

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 1 day
- Phase 2: 1 day
- Phase 3: 2 days
- Testing & refinement: 1 day
