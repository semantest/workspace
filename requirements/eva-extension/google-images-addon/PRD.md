# Product Requirements Document: Google Images Addon Adaptation

## Overview
Adapt the existing Google Images functionality into a modular addon that works with the Semantest framework, serving as the flagship example of our addon architecture.

## Background
We have working Google Images integration that needs to be:
1. Extracted from the main extension
2. Converted to addon format
3. Made dynamically loadable
4. Enhanced with Semantest features

## Goals
- Demonstrate addon architecture
- Maintain existing functionality
- Add natural language commands
- Enable image testing workflows
- Set pattern for future addons

## Requirements

### Core Functionality (Preserve)
1. **Image Search Integration**
   - Detect Google Images pages
   - Extract image metadata
   - Handle infinite scroll
   - Process search results

2. **Image Operations**
   - Click on images
   - Download images
   - Navigate image views
   - Extract image URLs

### New Semantest Features
1. **Natural Language Commands**
   ```
   "Download the first cat image"
   "Click on the largest image"
   "Save all images of cars"
   "Find images with red background"
   ```

2. **Smart Selectors**
   - Image content detection
   - Color-based selection
   - Size-based filtering
   - Similarity matching

3. **Batch Operations**
   - Download multiple images
   - Apply filters to sets
   - Create image collections
   - Generate reports

### Addon Architecture
1. **Manifest Structure**
   ```json
   {
     "id": "google-images-addon",
     "name": "Google Images Automation",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "domains": ["images.google.com", "google.com/images"],
     "permissions": ["downloads", "storage"],
     "scripts": ["google-images.js"],
     "styles": ["google-images.css"]
   }
   ```

2. **API Interface**
   - Standardized command format
   - Event emission system
   - State management
   - Error handling

3. **Integration Points**
   - Hook into Semantest commands
   - Provide custom actions
   - Export test scenarios
   - Analytics tracking

## Success Criteria
- Existing functionality preserved
- Natural language commands work
- <100ms command execution
- Clean addon separation
- Comprehensive documentation

## Timeline
- Code extraction: 1 day
- Addon conversion: 1 day
- Semantest integration: 1 day
- Testing and polish: 1 day
