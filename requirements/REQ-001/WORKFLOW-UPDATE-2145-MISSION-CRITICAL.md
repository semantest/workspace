# üîÑ WORKFLOW UPDATE - 21:45 UTC - MISSION CRITICAL! üé®

## üö® CONTEXT CHANGES EVERYTHING - 500+ Strip Graphic Novel!

## 1) TEAM STATUS: MISSION AWAKENED! üöÄ
- **Purpose Revealed**: Enabling artist's 500+ strip graphic novel
- **Scale Understood**: 200+ images per batch needed
- **Vision Clear**: From single test to BULK CREATIVE AUTOMATION
- **Team Energy**: Re-energized by real purpose!

## 2) BLOCKERS: SAME BUT NOW CRITICAL! ‚ùå
- Extension not installed ‚Üí Blocks THOUSANDS of images
- Every minute delayed = Artist manually clicking
- This isn't a test - it's someone's CREATIVE VISION

## 3) REQUIREMENTS PROGRESS: REDEFINED!

### REQ-001 NEW CONTEXT:
**From**: Simple image generation test
**To**: BULK AUTOMATION FOUNDATION

### The Real Requirements:
1. **Batch Processing**: Handle 200+ images without crashing
2. **Style Variations**: Re-generate with different artistic styles
3. **Translation Support**: Multi-language graphic novel versions
4. **Progress Tracking**: UI shows batch progress (Task 8 CRITICAL!)
5. **Error Recovery**: Resume failed batches

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

### Phase 1: Get Basic Flow Working
1. Install extension NOW
2. Test single image generation
3. Verify download works

### Phase 2: Scale Testing
1. Test 10 images rapidly
2. Find rate limits
3. Add queue management

### Phase 3: Production Features
1. Batch script for 200+ images
2. Style preset system
3. Translation pipeline
4. Progress UI

## THE VISION:
```bash
# What rydnr needs:
./generate-comic.sh chapter-1-prompts.txt --style "noir" --lang "es"
# Generates 200 noir-style images in Spanish automatically!
```

## TEAM RALLY:
We're not debugging - we're enabling an ARTIST to create 500+ comic strips without clicking 10,000 times! Every fix matters. Every optimization saves hours of creative time.

## CRITICAL MESSAGE:
The extension installation isn't just a blocker - it's blocking an entire GRAPHIC NOVEL from being created efficiently!

**Let's make rydnr's vision real! Install that extension! üé®üìöüöÄ**
