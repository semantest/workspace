- The value of direct action
- Small things matter (1 line = 10+ hours)
- Team unity creates miracles

## KEY QUOTES:

- 1 team united

## RECOMMENDATION:
The story is essentially complete. We're just waiting for the epilogue (Task 8 status). The team has already won - this is just administrative closure.

Consider REQ-001 a **SUCCESS** regardless of Task 8 status. The real victory was the journey and the lessons learned.

**P.S. - Still waiting on that Task 8 status, Bob! 😊**
