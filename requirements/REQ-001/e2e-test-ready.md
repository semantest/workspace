# 🚀 READY FOR E2E TESTING - Graphic Novel Production

## Extension Fix Applied ✅
- Version changed from '1.0.0-beta' to '1.0.0'
- Extension should now load properly in Chrome
- Ready for full end-to-end image generation testing!

## Immediate Test Plan

### Step 1: Verify Extension Installation
```bash
# After loading extension in Chrome:
1. Navigate to chrome://extensions/
2. Verify "Semantest" shows version 1.0.0
3. Check extension is enabled
4. Navigate to https://chat.openai.com
5. Handle consent popup
6. Verify extension icon in toolbar
```

### Step 2: Single Image Test
```bash
# Test basic functionality first
./generate-image.sh "Test: Hero standing in cyberpunk city, dramatic lighting"

# Expected flow:
1. Script connects to WebSocket server ✅
2. Server receives ImageRequestReceived event ✅
3. Extension receives event via WebSocket ← NEW!
4. Extension automates ChatGPT to generate image ← NEW!
5. Extension downloads image ← NEW!
6. Extension sends ImageDownloaded event ← NEW!
7. Script receives success and exits ← NEW!
```

### Step 3: Small Batch Test (5 images)
```bash
# Quick batch test
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo "Generating test image $i..."
  ./generate-image.sh "Graphic novel panel $i: Hero in action scene, high contrast black and white"
  sleep 10  # Give it time
done
```

### Step 4: Production Test (10 images)
```bash
# Run the prepared bulk test
/home/chous/work/semantest/requirements/REQ-001/bulk-generation-scripts/bulk-test-10.sh
```

## What to Monitor

### Chrome DevTools (F12)
1. **Network Tab → WS**:
   - Look for WebSocket connection to ws://localhost:8080
   - Should see messages flowing both ways
   
2. **Console**:
   - Extension logs
   - Any errors or warnings

### Terminal Output
```
Expected success output:
🎨 ChatGPT Image Generator
=========================
✅ Semantest server is already running
✅ Server health check passed
🔌 Connecting to Semantest server...
✅ Connected to Semantest server
📤 Sending ImageRequestReceived event...

🎉 SUCCESS! Image downloaded
📍 File path: /home/chous/Downloads/img-[timestamp].png
```
