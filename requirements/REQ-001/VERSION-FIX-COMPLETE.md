# âœ… VERSION FIX COMPLETE!

## Hi rydnr! I fixed it!

### The Problem:
- Version was: `"1.0.0-beta"`
- Chrome requires: Numeric only (no text)

### The Fix:
Changed manifest.json version to: `"1.0.0"`

### Next Steps:
1. Try loading the extension again from:
   `/home/chous/work/semantest/extension.chrome/build/`

2. It should now load successfully!

3. You'll see "ChatGPT Extension" in your extensions list

4. Click the extension icon to see the popup

5. Navigate to ChatGPT.com

6. Run: `./generate-image.sh "First comic strip test!"`

## Your 500+ Comic Strips Await!

The manifest is now fixed. Chrome's strict version requirement was the last blocker. You should be able to load the extension and start generating your graphic novel!

Let's make those 500 strips happen! ðŸŽ¨ðŸ“šðŸš€
