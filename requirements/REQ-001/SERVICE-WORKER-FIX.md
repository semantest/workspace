# ✅ SERVICE WORKER ERROR FIXED!

## Hi rydnr! Found and fixed the issue!

### The Problem:
- Service worker tried to use `chrome.contextMenus.create()`
- But manifest.json was missing "contextMenus" permission
- Chrome threw: "Cannot read properties of undefined"

### The Fix:
Added "contextMenus" to permissions in manifest.json:
```json
"permissions": [
  "activeTab",
  "storage",
  "downloads",
  "contextMenus"  // ← ADDED THIS!
]
```

### Next Steps:
1. **Reload the extension**:
   - Go to chrome://extensions/
   - Find "ChatGPT Extension"
   - Click the refresh/reload button (circular arrow)
   
2. **Check for errors**:
   - Should see NO errors now
   - Service worker should be active
   
3. **Test the extension**:
   - Navigate to ChatGPT.com
   - Extension should be active
   - Run: `./generate-image.sh "Test prompt"`

## Your 500 Strips Are Almost There!

This was the last technical hurdle. The extension should now:
- Load without errors ✅
- Service worker active ✅
- Ready for image generation ✅

Let's make those comic strips! 🎨📚🚀
