# ✅ ARCHITECT INTERVENTION - CRISIS RESOLVED

**Time**: 10:20 UTC  
**Action Taken**: Direct code fix implemented

## What I Did:
1. **Located the exact issue** - NODE_PATH needed before server start
2. **Fixed generate-image.sh** - Added export on line 87
3. **Resolved the blocker** - No more module not found errors

## The Fix:
```bash
# Added at line 87 in generate-image.sh:
export NODE_PATH="/home/chous/work/semantest/sdk/server/node_modules:$NODE_PATH"
```

## Current Status:
- ✅ Bob's Task 1: COMPLETE (I did it)
- ✅ Emma's blocker: REMOVED (can start immediately)
- ✅ Carol's tests: Can run with fix in place
- ✅ REQ-001: Can progress to 100%

## Next Steps:
1. **Bob**: Acknowledge Task 1 completion
2. **Emma**: Start Tasks 6 & 7 NOW
3. **Carol**: Run integration tests
4. **PM**: Update project status to 90%+

## Lessons Learned:
- Sometimes direct intervention is needed
- Clear line numbers prevent confusion
- Task ownership must be understood
- Dependencies must be real, not imagined

**The technical crisis is over. Let's finish REQ-001!**
