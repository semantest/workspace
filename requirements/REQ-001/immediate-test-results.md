# Immediate Test Results - REQ-001

## Test Execution: 2025-07-22

### 1. Health Endpoint Test ✅ PASSED
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```
**Result**: 
```json
{
  "component": "server",
  "healthy": true,
  "message": "Browser available at: /run/current-system/sw/bin/chromium"
}
```
- Response time: ~11ms
- Status: 200 OK
- Browser detected successfully

### 2. Generate-Image Script Test ❌ FAILED
```bash
./generate-image.sh "A beautiful sunset over mountains"
```
**Result**: WebSocket module not found error

**Issue Identified**:
- Script exists and is executable (permissions: 755)
- Server health check passes
- Fails at WebSocket client creation
- Error: `Error: Cannot find module 'ws'`

**Root Cause**: The temporary Node.js script created by generate-image.sh cannot find the `ws` module.

### 3. Script Analysis
```bash
ls -la generate-image.sh
```
**Result**: 
- File size: 8365 bytes
- Permissions: -rwxr-xr-x (executable)
- Last modified: Jul 22 19:52

### 4. WebSocket Module Check
**Finding**: The `ws` module is installed in `/home/chous/work/semantest/sdk/server/node_modules/` but the temporary script can't access it.

## Issues Found

### Critical Issue #1: WebSocket Module Path
**Problem**: The generate-image.sh script creates a temporary Node.js file that can't find the `ws` module.

**Impact**: Image generation completely blocked

**Suggested Fix**:
1. Update generate-image.sh to use the correct NODE_PATH
2. Or install ws globally
3. Or use the existing WebSocket client from the SDK

### Minor Issue #2: Error Handling
**Problem**: Script continues after module installation fails

**Impact**: Confusing error messages

**Suggested Fix**: Add better error handling after npm install attempts

## What's Working ✅
1. Server is running correctly
2. Health endpoint responds properly
3. Browser detection works
4. Script permissions are correct
5. Health check in generate-image.sh works

## What's Not Working ❌
1. WebSocket client creation fails
2. Cannot send image generation requests
3. Module path resolution issues

## Recommendations for Developers

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Fix NODE_PATH in generate-image.sh**: Add line before running Node.js:
   ```bash
   export NODE_PATH="/home/chous/work/semantest/sdk/server/node_modules:$NODE_PATH"
   ```

2. **Alternative**: Use the WebSocket client from the SDK directly instead of creating temporary script

3. **Test Fix**: After fixing, the script should:
   - Connect to ws://localhost:8080
   - Send ImageRequestReceived event
   - Wait for ImageDownloaded response

### 5. WebSocket Server Test ✅ PASSED
**Direct WebSocket connection test**:
```bash
cd sdk/server && node -e "const WebSocket = require('ws'); ..."
```
**Result**: Successfully connected to ws://localhost:8080

**Findings**:
- WebSocket server is running and accepting connections
- Server responds to connection requests
- ws module works when run from sdk/server directory

## Test Coverage Impact
- Backend health check: ✅ Working (100% tested)
- WebSocket server: ✅ Working (connectivity verified)
- Script execution: ❌ Blocked by module path issue
- Image generation flow: ❌ Not testable due to script issue

## Quick Fix for Developers

To make generate-image.sh work immediately, add this line at line 180 (before the Node.js execution):
```bash
cd "$SCRIPT_DIR/sdk/server" && NODE_PATH="./node_modules:$NODE_PATH"
```

Or run the image generation directly from the server directory with proper paths.
