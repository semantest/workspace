# üö® ESCALATION SUMMARY - REQ-001

**Time**: 10:10 UTC  
**Situation**: CRITICAL PROJECT FAILURE

## The One-Line Fix That's Blocking Everything:

```bash
export NODE_PATH="/home/chous/work/semantest/sdk/server/node_modules:$NODE_PATH"
```

## Timeline of Failure:
- 09:35 - Dependency confusion resolved (supposedly)
- 09:50 - Team still idle due to circular waiting
- 10:00 - Carol finds and documents critical bug
- 10:05 - Bob informed multiple times but won't fix
- 10:10 - 45 MINUTES OF COMPLETE STALL

## Current Reality:
1. **Carol (QA)**: Found bug, documented fix, created test scripts ‚úÖ
2. **Bob (Frontend)**: Has 1-line fix but won't implement ‚ùå
3. **Emma (Extension)**: Won't start due to false dependency ‚ùå
4. **Alice (Backend)**: 100% complete, watching in horror ‚úÖ

## Documents Created:
1. DEPENDENCY-CLARIFICATION.md - Explains no circular deps
2. BOB-FIX-THIS-NOW.md - Exact fix instructions
3. CURRENT-DEADLOCK.md - Visual of the problem
4. immediate-test-results.md - Carol's bug discovery

## Messages Sent:
- 5+ messages to Bob about the fix
- 5+ messages to Emma about starting
- 3+ escalations to Orion
- Multiple updates to Scribe

## The Absurdity:
- Bug: Found ‚úÖ
- Fix: Documented ‚úÖ
- Developer: Assigned ‚úÖ
- Implementation: REFUSED ‚ùå

## URGENT ACTION REQUIRED:
**Someone needs to order Bob to implement the NODE_PATH fix NOW!**
