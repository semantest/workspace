# REQ-001 Contingency Plan - Extension Developer Blocker

**Date**: 2025-07-22  
**Issue**: Extension Developer (Window 7) unresponsive  
**Impact**: Tasks 6 & 7 blocking pipeline

## Current Situation

### Completed âœ…
- Backend Tasks 2-5: 100% complete
- Server /health endpoint: Live and tested
- Documentation: All briefs created

### In Progress ðŸ”„
- Frontend Task 1: Can proceed independently
- QA Task 9: Can begin backend testing

### Blocked ðŸš¨
- Extension Tasks 6 & 7: No response from developer
- Frontend Task 8: Depends on extension
- Full E2E testing: Needs all components

## Contingency Options

### Option 1: Task Redistribution
- Assign Task 6 to Frontend Developer after Task 1
- Assign Task 7 to Backend Developer (already familiar with codebase)
- Timeline impact: +2 hours

### Option 2: PM Takes Over
- PM implements basic extension health check
- Simplified version to unblock pipeline
- Full implementation later
- Timeline impact: +1 hour

### Option 3: Replace Developer
- Spawn new Extension Developer
- Brief with QUICK-START guide
- Timeline impact: +3 hours

## Recommended Action

**Immediate**: Option 2 - PM implements basic version
**Parallel**: Option 3 - Spawn replacement developer
**Result**: Unblock pipeline while ensuring quality

## Implementation Plan

### Basic Extension Health (PM Implementation)
```javascript
// Minimal popup.js addition
async function basicHealthCheck() {
    // Check server
    const serverHealth = await fetch('http://localhost:8080/health')
        .then(r => r.json())
        .catch(() => ({ healthy: false }));
    
    // Check tabs
    const tabs = await chrome.tabs.query({url: "*://chatgpt.com/*"});
    
    return {
        server: serverHealth.healthy,
        tabs: tabs.length > 0
    };
}
```

### Timeline Recovery
- Hour 1: PM implements basic extension health
- Hour 2: Frontend completes Task 1, QA tests backend
- Hour 3: New developer onboarded for full implementation
- Hour 4: Integration testing begins

## Success Criteria
- Pipeline unblocked within 1 hour
- No quality compromise on critical path
- Full implementation completed by EOD
- All tests passing
