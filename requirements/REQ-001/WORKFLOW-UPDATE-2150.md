## 🔍 CRITICAL DISCOVERY - Extension Loading Path Issue!

## 1) TEAM STATUS: RAPID RESPONSE! ⚡
- Immediate investigation of build error
- Solution found quickly
- Team unified in helping rydnr

## 2) BLOCKERS: PATH CONFUSION! ⚠️

### The Issue:
- Error mentions: `semantest-background.js` ❌
- Actual file: `service-worker.js` ✅
- Likely cause: Loading from WRONG directory!

### The Solution:
**MUST load from**: `/home/chous/work/semantest/extension.chrome/build/`
**NOT from**: Parent directory or elsewhere

## 3) REQUIREMENTS PROGRESS: SO CLOSE!

### Current State:
- Extension IS built correctly ✅
- All files in place ✅
- Just needs correct loading ✅

## IMMEDIATE ACTION FOR USER:

1. Remove any existing extension attempts
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select SPECIFICALLY: `/home/chous/work/semantest/extension.chrome/build/`
5. Ensure you select the `build` folder itself

## KEY FILES VERIFIED:
- ✅ manifest.json (correct)
- ✅ service-worker.js (exists)
- ✅ chatgpt-controller.js (ready)
- ✅ popup.html & popup.js (present)

## THE STAKES:
- 500+ comic strips waiting
- Thousands of images to generate
- Artist's vision blocked by directory path

## TEAM MESSAGE:
We're THIS close! The extension is ready. The build is correct. We just need the right loading path!

**Let's get those 500 strips generating! 🎨📚**
