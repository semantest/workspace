# üîÑ WORKFLOW UPDATE - 21:35 UTC - REOPENED! üö®

## REQ-001: NOT COMPLETE - CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND

## 1) TEAM STATUS: SCRAMBLING! üö®
- Victory celebration interrupted
- Critical blocker discovered
- Extension not installed in browser
- Team notified and responding

## 2) BLOCKERS: CHROME EXTENSION NOT INSTALLED! ‚ùå

### The Problem:
- generate-image.sh connects to server ‚úÖ
- Server receives WebSocket event ‚úÖ
- But NO EXTENSION in browser to handle it ‚ùå
- Script times out after 30 seconds ‚ùå

### The Good News:
- Extension is ALREADY BUILT ‚úÖ
- Located at: `/home/chous/work/semantest/extension.chrome/`
- Just needs to be loaded into Chrome

## 3) REQUIREMENTS PROGRESS: BLOCKED!

### REQ-001: REOPENED
- Was celebrating at 95% complete
- Actually blocked at final step
- Need extension installed to test

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

1. **User Must Install Extension:**
   - Open chrome://extensions/
   - Enable Developer mode
   - Load unpacked ‚Üí extension.chrome folder

2. **Team Response:**
   - Created EXTENSION_INSTALL.md
   - Notified all team members
   - QA updating test prerequisites

## CRITICAL PATH:
```
Script ‚Üí Server ‚Üí Extension (MISSING!) ‚Üí ChatGPT ‚Üí Image
                       ‚Üì
                  BLOCKED HERE
```

## LESSON LEARNED:
We celebrated victory without end-to-end testing! The extension installation was assumed but never verified.

**REQ-001 CANNOT CLOSE WITHOUT WORKING EXTENSION!**
