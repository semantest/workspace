# ðŸš¨ EXTENSION BUILD ERROR - SOLUTION FOUND!

## THE PROBLEM:
User got error: "Could not load background script build/semantest-background.js"

## THE CAUSE:
There's a mismatch! The error mentions `semantest-background.js` but:
- manifest.json specifies: `service-worker.js` âœ…
- build/ contains: `service-worker.js` âœ…
- User might be loading from wrong directory!

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION:

### 1. Verify Loading Correct Directory
Make sure user is loading from:
```
/home/chous/work/semantest/extension.chrome/build/
```

NOT from:
- `/home/chous/work/semantest/extension.chrome/` (parent)
- Any other subdirectory

### 2. Chrome Extension Loading Steps:
1. Open Chrome/Chromium
2. Navigate to: `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (top right)
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Navigate SPECIFICALLY to: `/home/chous/work/semantest/extension.chrome/build/`
6. Select the `build` folder (not parent!)
7. Click "Select"

### 3. Verify These Files Exist in build/:
- âœ… manifest.json
- âœ… service-worker.js (NOT semantest-background.js)
- âœ… chatgpt-controller.js
- âœ… popup.html
- âœ… popup.js

### 4. If Still Getting Error:
The error mentioning "semantest-background.js" suggests:
- Old extension version loaded?
- Loading from wrong directory?
- Chrome cached old manifest?

**Try:**
1. Remove any existing "Semantest" or "ChatGPT Extension" from Chrome
2. Restart Chrome
3. Load fresh from build/ directory

## CRITICAL FILES:
- **Background Script**: `service-worker.js` (not semantest-background.js)
- **Content Script**: `chatgpt-controller.js`
- **Popup**: `popup.html` + `popup.js`

## FOR RYDNR:
Your 500+ comic strips are waiting! Make sure you're loading from the `build/` directory specifically. The extension is ready - just needs to be loaded from the right place!

**Path**: `/home/chous/work/semantest/extension.chrome/build/`
