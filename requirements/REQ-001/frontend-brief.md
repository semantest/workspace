# Frontend Developer Brief - REQ-001

Welcome Frontend Developer! You have been assigned to complete critical tasks for REQ-001.

## Your Tasks:

### Task 1: Update generate-image.sh script (Priority: HIGH)
- **Component**: Shell script
- **Estimated Hours**: 1
- **Current Status**: Backend has completed server-side health checks
- **Your Work**:
  - [ ] Add auto-start server functionality if not running
  - [ ] Implement health check before image requests
  - [ ] Add error handling for unhealthy states
  - [ ] Update documentation

### Task 8: Add health status UI (Priority: HIGH)
- **Component**: Extension popup UI
- **Estimated Hours**: 2
- **Dependencies**: Tasks 6, 7 (Extension developer will handle these)
- **Your Work**:
  - [ ] Show all layer statuses (Browser, Extension, Addon)
  - [ ] Clear visual indicators (green/yellow/red)
  - [ ] Action buttons for issues (e.g., "Launch Browser", "Open ChatGPT")
  - [ ] Responsive design

## Context:
- Backend has completed the server-side health check system
- Server exposes `/health` endpoint that returns browser status
- Extension developer will handle the extension/addon health checks
- Your UI should integrate all three layers of health status

## Files to Review:
1. `/home/chous/work/semantest/generate-image.sh` - Script to update
2. `/home/chous/work/semantest/extension.chrome/popup.html` - UI location
3. `/home/chous/work/semantest/sdk/server/src/health-checks/browser-health.ts` - Backend implementation

## Definition of Done:
- generate-image.sh automatically starts server and checks health
- Extension popup shows clear health status for all layers
- User can take action when issues are detected
- All code is tested and documented

Please begin with Task 1 and update the PM when complete. The backend team has already finished their work, so the server APIs are ready for integration.

**IMPORTANT**: Check `/home/chous/work/semantest/requirements/REQ-001/validate.sh` first to ensure all prerequisites are met!
