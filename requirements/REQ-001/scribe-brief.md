# Scribe Brief - REQ-001 Documentation

Welcome Scribe! You have been assigned a critical role in documenting our team's progress and learnings.

## Your Primary Role

As the team Scribe, your PRIMARY responsibility is to maintain the project journal (journal.md or journal.org) with:
- All team feedback and communications
- Key decisions and their rationale
- Progress updates from all team members
- Learnings and insights
- Challenges and resolutions
- Meeting notes and action items

## Initial Tasks

### 1. Create/Update journal.md
- Location: `/home/chous/work/semantest/requirements/REQ-001/journal.md`
- Format: Markdown with clear sections and timestamps
- Update frequency: Real-time as events occur

### 2. Document Current Status
Please document the following current state:
- REQ-001 is 70% complete
- Backend tasks 2-5 are 100% complete
- Frontend, Extension, and QA developers have been briefed
- Team is implementing a layered health check system

### 3. Key Information to Track

#### Team Progress
- Backend Developer (Window 2): Tasks 2-5 COMPLETE âœ…
- Frontend Developer (Window 3): Tasks 1 & 8 ASSIGNED ðŸ”„
- Extension Developer (Window 4): Tasks 6 & 7 ASSIGNED ðŸ”„
- QA Engineer (Window 5): Task 9 ASSIGNED ðŸ”„

#### Architecture Decisions
- Layered health check system with separation of concerns
- Server checks browser, Extension checks tabs, Addon checks login
- Each layer only knows about itself

#### Communication Patterns
- Backend worked silently but completed all tasks
- PM coordinates through tmux windows
- Briefing documents created for asynchronous communication

### 4. Journal Structure Recommendation

## Important Context

1. **Requirement System**: We follow requirement.md â†’ design.md â†’ task.md workflow
2. **Validation**: validate.sh must pass before development
3. **Current Phase**: Implementation phase with approved requirement and design
4. **Team Structure**: 8 windows total (PM, Architect, Backend, Frontend, Extension, QA, Scribe, Window 7)

## Communication Guidelines

- Monitor all windows for updates
- Document decisions in real-time
- Capture both successes and failures
- Note any process improvements
- Track technical debt and future considerations

## Files to Monitor

1. `/home/chous/work/semantest/requirements/REQ-001/task.md` - Task progress
2. `/home/chous/work/semantest/requirements/REQ-001/team-status.md` - Current status
3. Team briefing documents in REQ-001 folder
4. Any code changes related to health checks

Please begin by creating journal.md and documenting the current state of REQ-001 implementation!

**REMEMBER**: Your documentation helps the team learn and improve. Be thorough, be accurate, and capture the human side of development!
