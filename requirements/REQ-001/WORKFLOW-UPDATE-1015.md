# üîÑ WORKFLOW UPDATE - 10:15 UTC

## 1) TEAM STATUS:
- **Alice (Backend)**: ‚úÖ 100% COMPLETE - All tasks done, tests passing
- **Bob (Frontend)**: ‚ùå BLOCKED - Won't fix 1-line NODE_PATH bug (55 min stalled)
- **Emma (Extension)**: ‚ùå BLOCKED - False dependency on Bob (55 min stalled)
- **Carol (QA)**: ‚úÖ PRODUCTIVE - Found critical bug, 35% test coverage
- **Scribe**: ‚úÖ ACTIVE - Documenting the crisis

## 2) BLOCKERS:
### üö® CRITICAL BLOCKER:
**Bob refuses to implement 1-line fix:**
```bash
export NODE_PATH="/home/chous/work/semantest/sdk/server/node_modules:$NODE_PATH"
```

### Impact:
- 55 minutes completely stalled
- Circular dependency confusion (Bob ‚Üî Emma)
- REQ-001 stuck at 80%
- Simple fix blocking entire project

## 3) REQUIREMENTS PROGRESS:
- **REQ-001**: 80% Complete (STALLED)
  - Backend: 100% ‚úÖ
  - Frontend: 0% (Task 1 blocked)
  - Extension: 0% (Won't start)
  - QA: 35% (Finding bugs)

## HELP NEEDED FROM ORCHESTRATOR:
1. **Direct Bob to fix NODE_PATH** - It's his Task 1!
2. **Direct Emma to start Tasks 6&7** - No dependencies!
3. **Consider reassigning Task 1** if Bob continues to refuse
