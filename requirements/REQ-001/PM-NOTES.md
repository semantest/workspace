# PM Notes - REQ-001 Progress Tracking

## 2025-07-22 09:50 UTC

### Current State
- All developers are actively working (confirmed by Orchestrator)
- No responses to progress check messages yet
- This is likely normal "heads down" coding time

### Active Development
1. **Frontend (Window 3)**: Working on Task 1 - generate-image.sh auto-start
2. **Extension (Window 7)**: Working on Tasks 6&7 - health modules
3. **QA (Window 5)**: Directed to start real testing with guide

### Completed
- Backend: 100% done (Tasks 2-5)
- All documentation and briefs created
- Dependency confusion resolved

### Waiting For
- QA real test results (may take time to run tests)
- Frontend progress on generate-image.sh updates
- Extension progress on health modules
- Any blockers or questions from developers

### Key Learning
The team wasn't unresponsive earlier - they were waiting for dependency clarification. This shows:
- Developers are responsible and don't proceed without clarity
- Clear dependency documentation is critical
- Communication assumptions can cause unnecessary concern

### Next Actions
1. Allow developers focused coding time
2. Check for updates in 10 minutes
3. Be ready to support any questions
4. Monitor for test results from QA

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: All developers confirmed active
- **Timeline**: On track at 80% complete
- **Confidence**: High - no technical blockers identified
