# üîÑ WORKFLOW UPDATE - 21:40 UTC

## üö® EMERGENCY MODE - Extension Installation Critical

## 1) TEAM STATUS: EMERGENCY RESPONSE ‚ö°
- **Orion**: Created emergency docs & E2E checklist
- **Carol**: Standing by to test once installed
- **Team**: Unified in fixing the gap
- **Lesson**: Learned about premature celebration

## 2) BLOCKERS: EXTENSION NOT INSTALLED ‚ùå

### Current Situation:
- Server: ‚úÖ Working perfectly
- WebSocket: ‚úÖ Connected
- Message Format: ‚úÖ Correct
- **Extension Handler: ‚ùå MISSING - THE CRITICAL GAP**

### The Break Point:
```
Script ‚Üí Server ‚Üí [NO EXTENSION] ‚Üí üí• TIMEOUT
```

## 3) REQUIREMENTS PROGRESS: WAITING ON EXTENSION

### REQ-001 Status:
- Code: 95% complete
- Testing: Blocked
- **New Definition of Done**:
  - [ ] Extension installed in browser
  - [ ] E2E flow verified
  - [ ] User successfully generates image

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:

### For User:
1. Open `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable Developer mode
3. Load unpacked: `/home/chous/work/semantest/extension.chrome/`
4. Verify extension appears and is enabled
5. Navigate to ChatGPT.com
6. Run: `./generate-image.sh "Victory test"`

### Created Documents:
- **EMERGENCY-RESPONSE-2140.md**: Full emergency procedures

## KEY LEARNING:
"A perfect server talking to nobody, a perfect script waiting for nothing" - We built everything except the bridge!

## TEAM COMMITMENT:
We will NOT close REQ-001 until:
1. Extension is installed
2. E2E test passes
3. Image successfully downloads

**From premature celebration to proper completion!**
