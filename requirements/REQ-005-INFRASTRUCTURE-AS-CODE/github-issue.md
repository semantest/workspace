## Milestone
- Infrastructure v1.0

## Description

### Overview
We need to implement infrastructure as code (IaC) for the Semantest platform to enable automated deployment of our Node.js REST and WebSocket servers to AWS Lambda and Azure Functions. This implementation should follow Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Hexagonal Architecture principles.

### Background
As requested by @rydnr, we need a programmatic way to deploy our services using Pulumi. The infrastructure code should integrate with our existing event-driven architecture and support multi-cloud deployments.

### Requirements
- **Architecture**: DDD + Hexagonal Architecture
- **IaC Tool**: Pulumi
- **Languages**: TypeScript (preferred) or Python with PythonEDA
- **Cloud Providers**: AWS (Lambda) and Azure (Functions)
- **Components**: REST API server and WebSocket server

### Deliverables
1. **Domain Model** implementing infrastructure concepts
2. **Pulumi Adapters** for AWS and Azure
3. **CLI Tool** for deployment operations
4. **Event Integration** with Semantest event bus
5. **Documentation** and deployment guides

### Implementation Plan
The implementation is broken down into 6 phases over 2 weeks:
- Phase 1: Foundation and Domain Model (Days 1-3)
- Phase 2: AWS Implementation (Days 4-5)
- Phase 3: Application Layer (Days 6-7)
- Phase 4: CLI Implementation (Days 8-9)
- Phase 5: Azure Implementation (Days 10-11)
- Phase 6: Testing & Documentation (Days 12-14)

### Architecture Guidance
Detailed architecture guidance has been provided by Aria (System Architect) in the following documents:
- `/requirements/REQ-005-INFRASTRUCTURE-AS-CODE/requirement.md`
- `/requirements/REQ-005-INFRASTRUCTURE-AS-CODE/design.md`
- `/requirements/REQ-005-INFRASTRUCTURE-AS-CODE/task.md`

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Event-Driven Deployment**: Infrastructure changes will emit events compatible with our message bus
2. **Multi-Provider Support**: Abstract cloud provider details behind ports/adapters
3. **GitOps Ready**: All infrastructure defined as code with full audit trail
4. **Zero Manual Steps**: Complete automation from commit to deployment

### CLI Interface Preview
```bash
# Deploy REST API to AWS
semantest-iac deploy --component rest-api --provider aws --env production

# Deploy WebSocket to Azure
semantest-iac deploy --component websocket --provider azure --env staging

# Check deployment status
semantest-iac status --deployment <id>

# Rollback if needed
semantest-iac rollback --deployment <id>
```

### Success Criteria
- [ ] REST API successfully deploys to AWS Lambda
- [ ] WebSocket server successfully deploys to Azure Functions
- [ ] Deployment completes in < 5 minutes
- [ ] Rollback works correctly
- [ ] Events are published for all infrastructure changes
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage achieved
- [ ] Documentation is complete and clear

### Technical Risks & Mitigations
1. **Pulumi Learning Curve**: Start with tutorials, use examples
2. **Multi-Cloud Complexity**: Implement AWS first, then Azure
3. **Event Integration**: Test integration points early

### Questions for Architecture Team
- Should we support blue/green deployments in v1?
- What monitoring/alerting integration is required?
- Should we implement cost tracking from the start?
