# REQ-005: Infrastructure as Code for Semantest

## Overview
Implement infrastructure as code (IaC) for the Semantest platform using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Hexagonal Architecture principles with Pulumi as the provisioning engine.

## Business Requirements

### Primary Objectives
1. **Automated Deployment**: Enable programmatic deployment of NodeJS REST and WebSocket servers
2. **Multi-Cloud Support**: Support both AWS Lambda and Azure Functions
3. **Event-Driven Infrastructure**: Align infrastructure with Semantest's event-driven architecture
4. **GitOps Ready**: Version-controlled infrastructure with audit trail

### Success Criteria
- One-command deployment to multiple cloud providers
- Zero manual infrastructure configuration
- Complete infrastructure state tracking
- Rollback capability for all changes

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture Requirements
1. **DDD Structure**
   - Clear domain boundaries for infrastructure components
   - Separation of domain logic from infrastructure details
   - Event-driven deployment triggers

2. **Hexagonal Architecture**
   - Infrastructure providers as adapters
   - Domain models independent of cloud providers
   - Ports for deployment operations

3. **Event-Driven Integration**
   - Infrastructure events compatible with Semantest's event bus
   - Deployment workflows triggered by domain events
   - State changes published as events

### Implementation Requirements

#### Domain Layer
- `ServerlessFunction` aggregate for function deployments
- `ApiGateway` aggregate for API management
- `Deployment` aggregate for orchestration
- Value objects for configuration and constraints

#### Application Layer
- Command handlers for deployment operations
- Query handlers for infrastructure state
- Event handlers for reactive deployments
- Saga orchestrators for multi-step deployments

#### Infrastructure Layer
- Pulumi adapters for AWS and Azure
- Event bus integration
- State persistence adapters
- Monitoring and logging adapters

### Technology Stack
- **Language Options**: TypeScript (preferred) or Python with PythonEDA
- **IaC Engine**: Pulumi
- **Cloud Providers**: AWS, Azure
- **Event System**: Integration with existing Semantest event bus

## Functional Requirements

### Deployment Capabilities
1. **REST API Deployment**
   - Deploy Node.js REST server as serverless function
   - Configure API Gateway
   - Set up authentication and CORS
   - Configure environment variables

2. **WebSocket Server Deployment**
   - Deploy WebSocket server with appropriate runtime
   - Configure WebSocket API Gateway (AWS) or SignalR (Azure)
   - Set up connection management
   - Configure scaling policies

3. **Supporting Infrastructure**
   - Database provisioning (if needed)
   - Queue/Topic creation for event bus
   - IAM roles and policies
   - Monitoring and alerting setup

### CLI Interface
```bash
# Deploy REST API to AWS
semantest-iac deploy --component rest-api --provider aws --env production

# Deploy WebSocket to Azure
semantest-iac deploy --component websocket --provider azure --env staging

# Full deployment
semantest-iac deploy --all --provider aws --env production
```

### Configuration Management
- Environment-specific configurations
- Secrets management integration
- Feature flags support
- A/B deployment capability

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Deployment completion < 5 minutes
- Infrastructure state queries < 1 second
- Parallel deployment support

### Security
- Encrypted state storage
- Least-privilege IAM policies
- Network isolation by default
- Secrets never in plain text

### Reliability
- Idempotent deployments
- Automatic rollback on failure
- State locking for concurrent operations
- Disaster recovery procedures

### Observability
- Deployment audit logs
- Infrastructure cost tracking
- Performance metrics collection
- Health check automation

## Integration Requirements

### Semantest Platform Integration
- Event bus compatibility
- Shared configuration system
- Unified logging approach
- Common monitoring strategy

### CI/CD Integration
- GitHub Actions compatibility
- Automated testing of infrastructure
- Preview environments for PRs
- Production deployment gates

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must use existing Semantest event patterns
- Must support existing Node.js applications
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Must work with current Git workflow

### Business Constraints
- Minimize cloud costs
- Use existing team skills
- Complete MVP in 2 weeks
- Documentation required

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Pulumi CLI and SDK
- AWS/Azure accounts and credentials
- GitHub repository access
- NPM/Python package registries

### Internal Dependencies
- Semantest event bus
- Configuration service
- Monitoring infrastructure
- Team training on IaC

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Deployment Success**
   - REST API deploys successfully to AWS Lambda
   - WebSocket server deploys to Azure Functions
   - Both services accessible via public endpoints

2. **Event Integration**
   - Infrastructure changes trigger appropriate events
   - Deployment status observable via event stream
   - Rollback events handled correctly

3. **Operational Excellence**
   - Zero manual steps in deployment
   - Complete audit trail available
   - Rollback completes in < 2 minutes
   - Costs tracked per deployment

4. **Documentation**
   - Architecture diagrams complete
   - Deployment guide written
   - Troubleshooting guide available
   - Example configurations provided

## Timeline

### Week 1
- Domain model design
- Basic Pulumi setup
- AWS adapter implementation
- REST API deployment

### Week 2
- Azure adapter implementation
- WebSocket deployment
- Event integration
- Testing and documentation

## Risks

1. **Technical Risks**
   - Pulumi learning curve
   - Multi-cloud complexity
   - Event system integration challenges

2. **Mitigation Strategies**
   - Start with single cloud provider
   - Leverage Pulumi examples
   - Incremental integration approach
