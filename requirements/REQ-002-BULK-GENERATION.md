# REQ-002: Bulk Image Generation for Creative Revolution

**ID**: REQ-002  
**Date**: 2025-07-22  
**Status**: DRAFT  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Requester**: rydnr (500+ strip graphic novel creator)

## Overview
Transform Semantest from single-image tool to bulk creative automation platform capable of generating hundreds of images for graphic novels, with style variations, translations, and automatic layout.

## User Story
As a graphic novel creator  
I want to generate 200+ images in a single batch  
So that I can create my 500-strip novel in hours instead of months

## Current Pain Points
1. Single image generation with manual process
2. 30-second timeout per image
3. No batch processing
4. No style variations
5. No translation workflow
6. Manual panel arrangement

## Requirements

### 1. Batch Processing
- Handle 200+ prompts in single command
- Queue management for 1000+ images
- Progress tracking with ETA
- Pause/resume capability
- Failed image recovery

### 2. Parallel Generation
- 10+ concurrent image generations
- Intelligent rate limiting
- Resource management
- Priority queue options

### 3. Style Engine
- Apply different styles to same prompt
- Style presets (manga, noir, watercolor, etc.)
- Custom style definitions
- Consistent style across batch

### 4. Translation Pipeline
- Multi-language prompt support
- Automatic translation integration
- Maintain context across languages
- Cultural adaptation options

### 5. Layout Automation
- Detect panel boundaries
- Arrange in reading order
- Generate print-ready pages
- Multiple layout templates
- Export to PDF/CBZ/Web

## Success Metrics
- Generate 500 images in < 2 hours
- 95%+ success rate
- < 5 second per image average
- Support 10+ languages
- Professional print-ready output

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Core Batch System
```javascript
// Batch API
semantest.generateBatch({
  prompts: ["panel1", "panel2", ...],
  style: "noir",
  parallel: 10,
  onProgress: (current, total) => {},
  onComplete: (results) => {}
})
```

### Phase 2: Queue Architecture
- Redis/in-memory queue
- Worker pool management
- Failure retry logic
- Progress persistence

### Phase 3: Creative Tools
- Style variation engine
- Translation integration
- Layout templates
- Export systems

## Dependencies
- REQ-001 completion (basic functionality)
- Extension properly installed
- Server scaling capabilities
- ChatGPT API rate limits

## Impact
This transforms Semantest from a utility into a creative revolution platform, enabling:
- Solo creators to produce professional graphic novels
- Publishers to prototype stories rapidly
- Educators to create visual content
- Global content with automatic translation

## Questions
1. Preferred image formats for comics?
2. Standard panel layouts needed?
3. Translation service preferences?
4. Storage requirements for batches?
