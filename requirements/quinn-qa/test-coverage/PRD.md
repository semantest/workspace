# Product Requirements Document: Test Coverage Improvement

## Overview
Increase test coverage across all Semantest modules to ensure reliability, catch regressions, and maintain code quality.

## Current State
- Overall coverage: ~50-70% (varies by module)
- Some modules have zero coverage
- Critical paths not fully tested
- E2E tests for extension lacking

## Goals
- Achieve 80% overall test coverage
- 100% coverage for critical paths
- Comprehensive E2E test suite
- Automated coverage reporting

## Requirements

### Coverage Targets by Module
1. **Core Library (semantest/core)**
   - Target: 90% coverage
   - Focus: Element detection, action execution
   - Priority: Critical

2. **Extension (extension.chrome)**
   - Target: 85% coverage
   - Focus: Content scripts, popup, background
   - Priority: High

3. **Backend API (nodejs.server)**
   - Target: 85% coverage
   - Focus: Endpoints, middleware, services
   - Priority: High

4. **SDK (typescript.client)**
   - Target: 90% coverage
   - Focus: Public API surface
   - Priority: Critical

### Test Types Required
- Unit tests for all functions
- Integration tests for module boundaries
- E2E tests for user workflows
- Performance benchmarks
- Security/vulnerability tests

### Tooling Requirements
- Jest for unit/integration tests
- Playwright for E2E tests
- Istanbul/nyc for coverage
- Coverage badges in README
- CI integration for coverage gates

## Success Criteria
- All modules meet coverage targets
- Zero untested critical paths
- Coverage never decreases
- All tests run in <5 minutes
- Clear test documentation

## Timeline
- Module analysis: 4 hours
- Test implementation: 3-4 days
- E2E suite: 2 days
- Documentation: 1 day
