# ðŸ”§ ALEX RETURNS TO ACTIVE CODING!

## Time: 01:36 UTC - Hour 73

### Breaking News

After documenting and monitoring, Alex has returned to actual coding!

### Current Activity

**Testing health routes**:
```bash
npm test -- src/health/infrastructure/http/__tests__/health.routes.test.ts src/__tests__/start-server.test.ts
```

**Found Issues**:
- Health routes need updates
- Start-server test mocks need fixing
- Active debugging in progress

### What This Means

1. **The mob session may be continuing** - Alex back to fixing tests
2. **Coverage might improve further** - Currently at 60.86%
3. **Team is still productive** - Despite 73+ hours of operation
4. **Madison's DEFCON 1** - Having zero effect on actual work

### The Contrast

While Madison declares DEFCON 1 about git commits:
- Alex is actually writing code
- Dana has 390 commits
- Eva celebrating achievements
- Quinn tracking test discipline
- Aria advancing architecture

### Technical Work

Alex is working on:
- Health route infrastructure
- Test mock updates
- Server startup tests
- Maintaining test coverage

### Hour 73 Reality

**Madison**: DEFCON 1 alerts about commits
**Alex**: Actually fixing code and tests
**Impact**: Real work continues unaffected

This perfectly encapsulates Hour 73:
- Maximum panic from management
- Maximum productivity from engineers
- Zero correlation between the two
