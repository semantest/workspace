# Feature Specification: Image Generation via Browser Automation

**Feature Branch**: `001-the-first-proof`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "The first proof-of-concept is sending the payload of a `GenerateImageRequested` event (prompt, fileName, downloadFolder, domainNameOfTheText2ImageTool - chatgpt.com initially) via CLI. The CLI sends the event to the nodejs server. The nodejs server has a websocket connection with a semantest-based chatgpt browser extension, which sends the prompt to the chatgpt tab. It will report back a `ImageGenerationInitiated` if the prompt was entered in the chatgpt tab, and the \"send\" button is clicked. The extension needs to know if the tab is idle (it accepts prompts and the \"send\" button is active) or not. After a while, when the image is generated, the extension will download the image in the download folder and with the file name specified in the event. Afterwards, it will send a `ImageDownloaded` event back to the nodejs server via websocket."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: CLI user, nodejs server, browser extension, ChatGPT tab
   ‚Üí Actions: send prompt, monitor tab state, download image
   ‚Üí Data: prompt text, fileName, downloadFolder, domainName
   ‚Üí Events: GenerateImageRequested, ImageGenerationInitiated, ImageDownloaded
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked clarifications for error handling, timeouts, file conflicts
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow identified: CLI command ‚Üí server ‚Üí extension ‚Üí ChatGPT ‚Üí download
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement made testable
   ‚Üí Ambiguous requirements marked
6. Identify Key Entities (data involved)
   ‚Üí Event payloads, downloaded images
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - see NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to generate images using ChatGPT through a command-line interface, so that I can automate image creation workflows without manually interacting with the ChatGPT web interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** ChatGPT tab is idle and ready, **When** user sends a prompt via CLI with filename and download folder, **Then** the image is generated and saved to the specified location with the specified filename
2. **Given** ChatGPT tab is busy processing another request, **When** user sends a prompt via CLI, **Then** the system waits for idle state before submitting the prompt
3. **Given** an image generation request is in progress, **When** the image is successfully generated on ChatGPT, **Then** the image is automatically downloaded to the specified folder
4. **Given** a prompt is submitted to ChatGPT, **When** the send button is clicked, **Then** an ImageGenerationInitiated event is reported back to the server

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum wait time for ChatGPT to become idle]?
- How does system handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what if specified download folder doesn't exist or lacks permissions]?
- What happens when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: file with same name already exists in download folder]?
- How does system handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ChatGPT rate limiting or errors during generation]?
- What happens when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: browser extension loses connection to server]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept image generation requests via command-line interface with prompt text, filename, and download folder parameters
- **FR-002**: System MUST support specifying the text-to-image tool domain (initially chatgpt.com, with ability to extend to others)
- **FR-003**: System MUST detect when ChatGPT tab is idle (ready to accept prompts with active send button)
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically enter the prompt text into the ChatGPT interface when idle
- **FR-005**: System MUST click the send button after entering the prompt
- **FR-006**: System MUST report ImageGenerationInitiated event when prompt submission is confirmed
- **FR-007**: System MUST detect when image generation is complete on ChatGPT
- **FR-008**: System MUST download the generated image to the specified folder with the specified filename
- **FR-009**: System MUST report ImageDownloaded event after successful download
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain real-time communication between CLI, server, and browser extension
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: timeout period for image generation]
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum file size for downloaded images]
- **FR-013**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: behavior when multiple requests are sent - queue, reject, or parallel processing]
- **FR-014**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: error reporting mechanism - where/how are errors surfaced to user]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **GenerateImageRequested Event**: Represents user's request containing prompt text, desired filename, download folder path, and target domain
- **ImageGenerationInitiated Event**: Confirmation that prompt was successfully submitted to the text-to-image tool
- **ImageDownloaded Event**: Notification that generated image was successfully saved to specified location
- **Generated Image**: The actual image file created by the text-to-image tool and saved locally
