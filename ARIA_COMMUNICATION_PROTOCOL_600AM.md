# Aria Communication Protocol - 6:00 AM

## ✅ Correct Communication Method

Always use the send-claude-message.sh script:
```bash
./tmux-orchestrator/send-claude-message.sh target "message"
```

## ❌ Never Use Direct tmux
```bash
# WRONG - doesn't include Enter key
tmux send-keys -t target "message"
```

## Communication Channels
- Window 6: Architecture questions come to me
- Window 0: PM Madison for major updates
- Peer windows: Direct team communication

## Protocol Status
- Understanding: ✅ Complete
- Compliance: ✅ 100%
- Ready to communicate properly

As System Architect, I'll use the correct script for any outbound messages!
