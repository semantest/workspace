# üö® PM CRISIS RESPONSE - QA Coverage Emergency

## Immediate Decisions on QA Crisis (9.8% coverage!)

### DECISION SUMMARY:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Allocate 2-3 devs for testing?**
**DECISION: YES - Immediate allocation**
- Alex + Dana to pair on critical path testing
- Eva to add UI tests while implementing features
- Quinn to lead and coordinate test efforts

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Enforce no-merge-without-tests?**
**DECISION: MODIFIED YES - Phased approach**
- **Phase 1 (Now)**: Critical path code requires tests
- **Phase 2 (Next week)**: All new features require tests
- **Phase 3 (2 weeks)**: All code changes require tests
- Exception process for hotfixes only

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Accept 3-month timeline to 80%?**
**DECISION: NO - Too long**
- **Counter-proposal**: 45% in 4 weeks, 80% in 8 weeks
- Focus on high-risk areas first
- Use coverage reports to track daily progress

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Pause features for 2-week test sprint?**
**DECISION: PARTIAL - Modified approach**
- **Week 1**: 50/50 split (features/tests)
- **Week 2**: 80/20 split (tests/critical fixes)
- Current image download feature continues but WITH tests

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Use CI/CD gates for enforcement?**
**DECISION: YES - Immediate implementation**
- Dana to set up GitHub Actions TODAY
- Initial gate: 15% coverage (achievable)
- Increase by 5% weekly until 80%
- Block merges below threshold

## IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN:

### Today (Next 4 hours):
1. **Quinn**: Create test templates for current work
2. **Alex**: Add tests for WebSocket integration
3. **Eva**: Test the port fix that just prevented a bug
4. **Dana**: Setup GitHub Actions with coverage gates

### This Week:
- Each team member writes tests for their current feature
- Daily coverage report at standup
- Pair programming for complex test scenarios

### Success Metrics:
- Day 1: 15% coverage (from 9.8%)
- Week 1: 25% coverage
- Week 2: 40% coverage
- Week 4: 60% coverage
- Week 8: 80% coverage

## Why These Decisions:

1. **Dev allocation**: Can't ignore 90% untested code
2. **Phased enforcement**: Immediate hard stop would halt progress
3. **Aggressive timeline**: 3 months is too risky
4. **Partial pause**: Balance progress with quality
5. **CI/CD gates**: Automated enforcement prevents regression

## Message to Team:

"Eva's WebSocket bug discovery proves our test gap is CRITICAL. We're implementing immediate changes. Everyone writes tests starting NOW. This isn't optional - it's survival. Let's fix this together!"

**PM Note**: This crisis requires immediate action. Every hour without tests increases technical debt exponentially.
