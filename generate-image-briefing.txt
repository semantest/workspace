TEAM BRIEFING: ChatGPT Image Generation Implementation

MISSION: Implement end-to-end image generation workflow using ImageRequestReceived/ImageDownloaded events

KEY REQUIREMENTS:

1. ImageRequestReceived Event:
   - project?: string (optional - if null, don't create project)
   - chat?: string (optional - if null, create new chat)
   - prompt: string (required - the image generation prompt)

2. ImageDownloaded Event:
   - path: string (required - path where image was saved)

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS:

1. Event Handler Implementation
   - Listen for ImageRequestReceived events
   - If chat is null, create a new chat
   - If project is provided, use it; if null, don't create project
   - Trigger image download process

2. Image Download Logic
   - Download images to ~/Downloads/ directory
   - Emit ImageDownloaded event with the file path

3. Shell Script Wrapper
   Create generate-image.sh with usage:
   ./generate-image.sh 'prompt' [download-folder]
   - Default download folder: ~/Downloads/
   - Should trigger the ImageRequestReceived event

TEAM ASSIGNMENTS:
- Windows 1-2: Event System Implementation
- Windows 3-4: ChatGPT Integration
