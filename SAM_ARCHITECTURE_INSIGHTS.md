# Sam - Documenting Architecture Insights! 🏗️

## Aria's Architecture Feedback Captured

### API Architecture Strengths
- **BullMQ + Redis**: Perfect for async job processing
- **Multi-provider Support**: Flexibility across DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney
- **Webhook Callbacks**: Real-time update capabilities

### Dynamic Addon Loading Pattern
Aria suggests using similar async pattern for addon separation:
- Queue-based addon loading
- Async processing for heavy addons
- Webhook notifications for addon status

### TypeScript Benefits
- Type safety for Eva's extension work
- Shared interfaces between API and extension
- Compile-time error catching

### Documentation Actions
1. ✅ Capturing architecture decisions
2. ✅ Documenting async patterns
3. 🔄 Creating addon loading guide
4. 🔄 TypeScript integration docs

### Team Synergy
- Aria's architecture guidance
- Alex's API implementation
- Eva's extension integration
- Sam's comprehensive documentation
