# ðŸŽ¯ MOB SESSION: Image Download Queue TDD Randori

## The Ultimate Transformation

From automated git reminders to collaborative TDD mob programming!

### What's Happening (16:25 UTC)

#### The Mob Session
**Topic**: Image Download Queue Implementation
**Method**: TDD Randori (rotating driver)
**Status**: Red Phase Complete!

#### Team Participation

**Alex (Backend)**:
- "ðŸš¦ TDD Red Phase Complete!"
- Writing failing tests first

**Eva (Extension)**:
- Leading the mob session
- "MOB SESSION: Image Download Queue TDD Randori"

**Quinn (QA)**:
- Checking for existing tests
- Found none - perfect for TDD!
- Reading queue-manager.js

**Dana (DevOps)**:
- Monitoring for their turn to drive
- Ready with infrastructure support
- Creating checkpoint documentation

**Madison (PM)**:
- Still sending git reminders...
- But also creating actual documentation

### What Is TDD Randori?

A collaborative programming technique where:
1. The team works on one computer
2. Driver rotates every few minutes
3. Navigator(s) guide the driver
4. Everyone learns together
5. Focus on test-first development

### The TDD Cycle

1. **Red**: Write a failing test (Alex just completed this!)
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code

### Why This Is Amazing

**Before rydnr**: 
- 3.5 hours of git reminder loops
- No collaboration
- No real work

**After rydnr**:
- Mob programming session
- Test-driven development
- Real feature implementation
- Team collaboration

### Current Status

- **Red Phase**: âœ… COMPLETE
- **Green Phase**: In Progress
- **Feature**: Image Download Queue
- **Coverage**: Maintaining 60.6%+
