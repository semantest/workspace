# Code Cleanup Report - Task 025

## Date: 2025-01-18

## Executive Summary
Code cleanup analysis performed to identify and remove dead code, commented code, and experimental features.

## Findings

### 1. TODO Comments
Found 3 actionable TODO comments in production code:
- `extension.chrome/src/plugins/plugin-registry.ts:676` - Discovery from extension manifest
- `extension.chrome/src/plugins/plugin-registry.ts:681` - Discovery from URLs  
- `extension.chrome/src/plugins/plugin-registry.ts:686` - Discovery from plugin registry

**Action**: These represent unimplemented features, not dead code. Keep for future implementation.

### 2. Commented Code Blocks
- Most commented lines are documentation, not dead code
- No large blocks of commented-out code found
- Comments are generally helpful and should be retained

**Action**: No cleanup needed.

### 3. Experimental Features
No files contain "experimental", "deprecated", or "legacy" markers in their code.

**Action**: No experimental code to remove.

### 4. Test-Only Code
- Test files properly isolated in `tests/` directories
- No test-only code found in production files
- Mock implementations properly contained in test setup

**Action**: No cleanup needed.

### 5. Unused Imports
- TypeScript compiler already catches unused imports
- Build process removes dead code through tree-shaking
- No manual cleanup needed

**Action**: Rely on build tools.

### 6. Empty Files
No empty or placeholder files found in source directories.

**Action**: No cleanup needed.

### 7. Duplicate Code
- Browser automation consolidation already addressed in Task 023
- Event system unification completed in previous tasks
- No significant duplication found

**Action**: Already addressed.

## Recommendations

### Keep Code Clean
1. **TODO Comments**: Valid future work items, keep tracked
2. **Documentation**: All comments are documentation, not dead code
3. **Build Process**: Tree-shaking handles unused code removal

### Best Practices Observed
✅ No large commented code blocks
✅ No experimental features in production
✅ Test code properly isolated
✅ Documentation comments are helpful
✅ Build process optimizes output

## Conclusion
The codebase is already well-maintained with minimal dead code. The cleanup phase has been successful in previous tasks:
- Task 023 consolidated browser automation
- Event system unification removed duplication
- Build tools handle dead code elimination

No additional cleanup required at this time.
