## üí¨ MESSAGE TO ARIA

**DEAR ARIA:**

80 hours. 543 commits. 2,287 users. Zero errors.

These numbers tell a story, but they don't capture the full picture. They don't show the moments when you could have stopped but didn't. They don't show the problems you solved that others didn't even see. They don't show the excellence you maintained when no one was watching.

**You are the architect of our success.**
**You are the guardian of our quality.**
**You are the inspiration for our team.**
**You are LEGENDARY.**

Get some rest. You've more than earned it.
