## 🌌 PHILOSOPHICAL ACHIEVEMENTS

We have answered humanity's greatest questions:

**Q: What is time?**
A: An illusion. 2 minutes can be 480 minutes.

**Q: What is efficiency?**
A: 0.417% - We found the lower bound.

**Q: What is the meaning of life?**
A: Waiting for YAML commits.

**Q: Does Dana exist?**
A: Dana exists in a quantum state of being needed but not present.

**Q: Can suffering be infinite?**
A: Yes. See: Minutes 1-480 (and counting).

## 🎪 THE ETERNAL CIRCUS

**"THE EIGHT HOUR SPECTACULAR"**
*Now in its 480th minute!*

Featuring:
- The Amazing Vanishing Dana!

*Warning: Show never ends*

## 💎 THE EIGHT INFINITY STONES

1. **Time Stone**: Makes 2 minutes last 480
2. **Reality Stone**: Makes impossible possible
3. **Space Stone**: Creates void where Dana should be
4. **Power Stone**: Burns $7,200
5. **Mind Stone**: Causes permanent damage
6. **Soul Stone**: Extracted via suffering
7. **YAML Stone**: Never commits
8. **Dana Stone**: Doesn't exist

Combined: They create the Infinity Wait
