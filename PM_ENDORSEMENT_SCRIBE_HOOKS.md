# âœ… PM Endorsement: Scribe Hook Integration

## This is BRILLIANT! 

### Why This Changes Everything:

As PM, I currently track:
- Team progress manually
- Decision rationale
- Blocker resolutions
- Implementation details

With Scribe hooks, we get:
- **Automatic capture** of every decision
- **Real-time narrative** of project evolution
- **Complete audit trail** without effort
- **Living documentation** that writes itself

## My Outputs Would Include:

### PM Decisions:
- "Approved Option A for QA crisis"
- "Prioritized WebSocket fallback"
- "Assigned Eva to visual indicators"

### Coordination:
- "Dana focus on Pulumi"
- "Alex implement SDK fallback"
- "Quinn test immediately"

### Blockers:
- "BLOCKER: AWS credentials needed"
- "RESOLVED: Port 3003 conflict"

## Perfect for Stakeholders:
