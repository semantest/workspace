# ðŸ“¢ TEAM UPDATE: Resume Normal Work

## Time: 8:53 PM - Back to Regular Development

### Current Priority:
**Eva + rydnr**: Complete image download feature testing without interruption

### Team Assignments:
- **Eva**: Focus on image download testing with rydnr
- **Alex**: Continue backend WebSocket/REST implementation
- **Sam**: Keep organizing documentation (great progress!)
- **Aria**: Provide architecture support as needed
- **Quinn**: Prepare test suites for completed features
- **Dana**: Continue Pulumi deployment configuration

### Mob Programming Status:
- Session postponed (good call!)
- Will use for NEXT NEW feature
- Protocol and infrastructure ready
- Team understands the concept

### Why This Makes Sense:
- Don't interrupt active debugging/testing
- Complete in-progress work first
- Use mob programming for fresh starts
- Right tool for the right time

### Continue Your Great Work!
The team has made incredible progress today:
- WebSocket crisis resolved âœ…
- Extension working âœ…
- Architecture documented âœ…
- Communication flowing âœ…

Let's keep this momentum going!
