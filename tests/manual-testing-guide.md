3. Monitor system performance

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] All requests are processed
- [ ] No request conflicts
- [ ] Files download correctly
- [ ] System performance remains stable

---

### 5. Large File Handling

**Steps**:
1. Request generation of complex, high-resolution image
2. Use detailed prompt (500+ characters)
3. Monitor download progress

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Large prompt handled correctly
- [ ] Download completes successfully
- [ ] File integrity verified
- [ ] Memory usage remains reasonable

---

### 6. Recovery Testing

#### 6.1 Server Restart During Operation
**Steps**:
1. Start image generation request
2. Restart event server mid-process
3. Restart other components
4. Check request status

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] System detects server restart
- [ ] Request state is preserved (if implemented)
- [ ] Recovery mechanisms activate
- [ ] Operation completes or fails gracefully

#### 6.2 Browser Crash Recovery
**Steps**:
1. Start image generation
2. Force-close browser during generation
3. Restart browser and extension
4. Check system state

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Server-side request tracking continues
- [ ] Extension reconnects properly
- [ ] Clear status provided to user
- [ ] Option to retry available

---

### 7. Performance Validation

#### 7.1 Response Time Test
**Steps**:
1. Record start time of request
2. Submit standard image request
3. Record completion time
4. Repeat 5 times for average

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Average response time < 3 minutes
- [ ] Consistent performance across runs
- [ ] No degradation over time
- [ ] Acceptable variance (¬±30 seconds)

#### 7.2 Memory Usage Monitoring
**Steps**:
1. Monitor system memory before test
2. Process 10 consecutive image requests
3. Monitor memory after completion
4. Check for memory leaks

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Memory usage increase < 50MB
- [ ] Memory returns to baseline after GC
- [ ] No evidence of memory leaks
- [ ] System remains responsive

---

### 8. Security Validation

#### 8.1 Path Traversal Prevention
**Steps**:
1. Attempt to use filename: "../../../etc/passwd"
2. Try various path traversal patterns
3. Check if files are created in expected locations

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Path traversal attempts blocked
- [ ] Files only created in designated directories
- [ ] Security warnings logged
- [ ] No system compromise

#### 8.2 Input Sanitization
**Steps**:
1. Submit prompt with HTML/JavaScript: `<script>alert('xss')</script>`
2. Use special characters and Unicode
3. Test very long prompts (10,000+ chars)

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] HTML/JS content sanitized
- [ ] Special characters handled safely
- [ ] Long prompts either processed or rejected gracefully
- [ ] No code execution vulnerabilities

## üîç Debugging Guide

### Log File Locations
- Event Server: `./logs/event-server.log`
- CLI Client: `./logs/client.log`
- Browser Extension: Browser Developer Console
- System Errors: `./logs/error.log`

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "Connection refused"
**Diagnosis**: Server not running
**Solution**: Start event server with `node start-event-server.js`

#### Issue: "Extension not responding"
**Diagnosis**: Browser extension not installed/enabled
**Solution**: Install extension and refresh page

#### Issue: "File download failed"
**Diagnosis**: Permission or disk space issues
**Solution**: Check directory permissions and available space

#### Issue: "Request timeout"
**Diagnosis**: Network or ChatGPT service issues
**Solution**: Check network connectivity and ChatGPT status

### Performance Issues

#### Slow Response Times
- Check network latency to OpenAI services
- Monitor system resource usage
- Verify browser extension is not blocking

#### High Memory Usage
- Check for memory leaks in Node.js processes
- Monitor browser tab memory usage
- Restart services if needed
