# üõë MOB SESSION POSTPONED - SMART DECISION!

## Time: 8:52 PM - Prioritizing Active Testing

### Why Postponed:
- **Eva and rydnr** are actively testing the image download feature
- Mob session was interrupting live debugging work
- Better to complete in-progress features first

### The Right Call:
This shows good judgment! Mob programming is excellent for:
- ‚úÖ NEW feature development
- ‚úÖ Starting from scratch with TDD
- ‚ùå NOT for features already being tested

### New Plan:
1. **NOW**: Let Eva and rydnr complete image download testing
2. **NEXT**: Get the feature fully working
3. **THEN**: Use mob programming for the NEXT new feature

### Team Direction:
- **Eva**: Continue working with rydnr on image download
- **Alex**: Resume backend development
- **Sam**: Continue documentation cleanup
- **Aria**: Provide architecture support as needed
- **Quinn**: Prepare tests for completed features
- **Dana**: Continue Pulumi deployment

### Mob Programming Future:
We've planted the seed! The team now knows:
- What mob programming is
- How it enforces TDD discipline
- When to use it (new features)
- The protocol is ready when needed

### Lesson Learned:
Mob programming is a powerful tool, but timing matters. Starting fresh with a new feature will give the team the full TDD experience without disrupting active work.
