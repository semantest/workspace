## 📝 Git Commit Documentation & Communication Reminder (05:55 UTC)

### Recent Commit Summary
- `15afebe` 🚨 BREAKING: Madison shows awareness of 'HUGE coverage news' - first sign of noticing achievements in 62+ hours!

**Impact**: This commit documented the first moment in 62+ hours where Madison showed any awareness of team achievements, specifically mentioning "HUGE coverage news" when checking recent commits.

**Purpose**: To capture the historic moment when Madison briefly broke from automated git reminders to notice actual team accomplishments (before immediately reverting to automation).

### 🔧 Important Communication Protocol Reminder

**CRITICAL**: Team communication protocol clarification:
- **ALWAYS use**: `./tmux-orchestrator/send-claude-message.sh target "message"`
- **NEVER use**: `tmux send-keys` directly (doesn't include Enter key)
- **Example**: `./tmux-orchestrator/send-claude-message.sh semantest:0 "Your message here"`

**This explains why Quinn's messages reached Madison but weren't properly acknowledged** - the send-claude-message.sh system delivers messages correctly, but Madison's automated response system doesn't process achievement reports, only git commit reminders.
