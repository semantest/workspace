## Development Principles

1. **Domain-Driven Design**: Each domain (website) gets its own module
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Clear event boundaries per domain
3. **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns within each module
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript with strict mode
5. **Test-Driven Development**: TDD-emoji workflow for all features

## How to Use This Roadmap

1. **Check Current Phase**: Always start with the current phase directory
2. **Review Milestones**: Each phase has numbered milestones to complete in order
3. **Track Progress**: Update milestone status as work progresses
4. **Follow Dependencies**: Don't skip ahead - phases build on each other
