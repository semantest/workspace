**Duration**: Completed in first sprint  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Summary

Successfully scanned the entire codebase for all variations of "buddy" references, exceeding initial estimates.

## Results

### Key Metrics
- **Files Found**: 184 (exceeded estimate of 164)
- **Total Occurrences**: 2,380 buddy references
- **Test Cases Created**: 120 comprehensive patterns
- **Deliverables**: 10 files in `/scripts/`

### Variation Patterns Found

6. Other variations: 573 occurrences

## Deliverables

### Created Files
- `scripts/scan-buddy-references.ts` - Main scanning script
- `scripts/buddy-scan-report.json` - Detailed JSON report (18K+ lines)
- `scripts/buddy-variations-test-cases.md` - 120 test cases
- `scripts/security-audit-checklist.md` - Security review checklist
- `scripts/buddy-scan-findings.md` - Summary report template
- `scripts/analyze-buddy-patterns.ts` - Pattern analysis tool
- `scripts/buddy-pattern-analysis.json` - Pattern breakdown
- `buddy_references.txt` - Simple file list

### Team Contributions
- **Engineer**: Created comprehensive scanning script
- **QA**: Defined 120 test cases covering all variations
- **Security**: Created security audit checklist
- **Scribe**: Documented findings and created templates

## Lessons Learned

1. **Underestimated Scope**: Found 20 more files than initial scan
2. **Pattern Complexity**: Multiple variations require careful mapping
3. **Security Concerns**: Several API keys and env vars need careful handling
