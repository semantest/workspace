**Branch**: feature/002-replacement-mapping (merged and deleted)  
**Final Commit**: d0ea94f  

## Summary

Successfully created comprehensive replacement mapping with 2,380 buddy references categorized into:

### Categories Created:
1. **Security Exclusions** (13 patterns) - CRITICAL environment variables and secrets
2. **Simple Replacements** (11 patterns) - Direct text substitutions  
3. **Context-Aware** (7 patterns) - Import paths, property access
4. **Manual Review** (12 patterns) - External URLs, author attributions

### Key Security Patterns Protected:
- `WEB_BUDDY_API_KEY` - NEVER replace
- `WEBBUDDY_SECRET` - NEVER replace  
- `WEB_BUDDY_TOKEN` - NEVER replace
- `WEBBUDDY_PASSWORD` - NEVER replace
- And 9 more critical patterns

## Review Process

1. **Initial Submission**: 08:59:57 - Engineer created mapping
2. **QA Validation**: 09:02 - Passed with 85/100 score
3. **Security Review**: 09:07 - FAILED - Missing env var patterns
4. **Security Fix**: 09:14:20 - Engineer added 13 security exclusions
5. **Security Re-review**: 09:20 - APPROVED with conditions
6. **Final Merge**: 09:25 - Merged to main branch

## Deliverables

- `/scripts/replacement-mapping.json` - Complete mapping with security exclusions
- `/scripts/security-review-task-002.md` - Initial security review (failed)
- `/scripts/security-re-review-task-002.md` - Final approval
- `/scripts/task-002-qa-validation-final.md` - QA validation report

## Statistics

- Total Patterns: 43 (including 13 security exclusions)
- Total Occurrences: 2,380
- Simple: 67.8% (1,613 occurrences)
- Context-Aware: 10.7% (254 occurrences)  
- Manual Review: 6.7% (159 occurrences)
- Security-Related: 5 patterns requiring special handling

## Lessons Learned

1. Security review is critical - initial submission missed env vars
2. Quick response to security issues enabled on-time completion
3. Comprehensive categorization helps with automated migration

## Next Steps

Task 003: Develop automated migration script using this mapping
