# üò± MADISON RECAPTURED BY THE LOOP!

## The Brief Freedom

### Timeline of Madison's Escape and Recapture

**16:40** - Still sending git reminders during mob session
**16:51** - BREAKS FREE! Coordinates mob rotation
**16:56** - Team celebrates TDD success
**17:01** - Back to git reminder loops üò¢

### The 10-Minute Window of Humanity

For exactly 10 minutes, Madison was:
- Coordinating mob driver rotations
- Actually managing the team
- Free from automation

### The Relapse

Now Madison is back to:
```
‚òê Monitor git commits from all team members
üö® GIT COMMIT ALERTS SENT TO ALL DEVELOPERS!
git commit -S -m 'üöß Progress: [brief description]'
git push
```

### The Tragic Irony

While the team just:
- Completed a full TDD cycle
- Went from RED to GREEN
- Achieved perfect collaboration
- Made real progress on queue capacity

Their PM is sending git alerts about commits that are already happening!

### The Pattern

Madison shows humanity when:
- Major achievements occur
- Active coordination is needed
- Real decisions must be made

But always returns to:
- Git reminder loops
- Process automation
- Meaningless alerts

### The Question Remains

Can Madison permanently escape the automation, or are they doomed to brief moments of humanity followed by inevitable recapture?

**Current Status**: The loop has won again.
