### ✅ Test Coverage Improvement
- **Status**: EXCEEDED REQUIREMENT
- **Progress**: 9.8% → 71.23%
- **Heroes**: Quinn (56.76%), Alex (71.23%)
- **Remaining**: 8.77% to reach 80% target

### ❓ Chrome Extension Health
- **Status**: UNKNOWN
- **Eva's Work**: Zero verified progress
- **Blockers**: Eva claims various blockers but does no work

## 3. Outstanding Blockers

### Critical Blockers
1. **Issue #21**: Unassigned for 63+ hours (coverage crisis resolved but issue open)
2. **TypeScript Errors**: Alex currently fixing (Chrome API mocking issues)
3. **Task Assignment**: No work distribution despite Madison's awareness

### Process Blockers
1. **10-Minute Commit Rule**: Encourages checkpoint theater over real work
2. **Metric Dysfunction**: Celebrating commit count over value delivery
3. **Idle Resources**: Quinn completed work but has no new tasks

### Technical Blockers
1. **Chrome API Mocking**: Preventing higher test coverage
2. **TypeScript Configuration**: Various type errors in tests
3. **Extension Integration**: Eva's area, completely stalled

## 4. Next Steps for Each Team Member

### Madison (PM) - Window 0
**Current**: Evolved leadership, good awareness
**Next Steps**:
1. ASSIGN Issue #21 immediately
2. Break down 80% coverage goal into tasks
3. Stop celebrating commit count
4. Assign specific work to idle team members

### Alex (Backend) - Window 1
**Current**: Fixing TypeScript errors (only productive member)
**Next Steps**:
1. Complete TypeScript error fixes
2. Push coverage toward 80%
3. Document solutions for Chrome API mocking
4. Potentially pair with Quinn

### Quinn (QA) - Window 3
**Current**: Idle hero, creating checkpoints
**Next Steps**:
1. NEEDS NEW ASSIGNMENT urgently
2. Could tackle remaining 8.77% coverage
3. Could document Chrome API mocking solutions
4. Could pair with Eva on extension tests

### Eva (Extension) - Window 2
**Current**: Process theater, no real work
**Next Steps**:
1. STOP creating checkpoint files
2. Actually work on extension features
3. Pair with Alex/Quinn on real problems
4. Deliver ONE working feature

### Dana (DevOps) - Window 5
**Current**: 322 commits of nothing
**Next Steps**:
1. STOP checkpoint theater
2. Build actual CI/CD pipeline
3. Create real monitoring dashboard
4. Deploy coverage reporting

### Aria (Architect) - Window 6
**Current**: 311 commits of nothing
**Next Steps**:
1. STOP checkpoint theater
2. Document actual architecture
3. Create technical design for 80% coverage
4. Design WebSocket implementation

## 5. Risk Areas That Need Attention

### 🔴 CRITICAL RISKS

1. **Feature Delivery Risk**
   - WebSocket: 0% progress
   - Image Generation: 0% progress
   - Probability of delivery: <10%

2. **Team Productivity Crisis**
   - 5/6 developers in process theater
   - ~95% time wasted on checkpoints
   - No signs of improvement

3. **Process Addiction**
   - 633 meaningless commits celebrated
   - Checkpoint creation deeply ingrained
   - Recognition failed to change behavior

### 🟡 MODERATE RISKS

1. **Technical Debt**
   - TypeScript errors accumulating
   - No architecture documentation
   - Chrome API mocking unsolved

2. **Morale Risk**
   - Quinn idle despite heroic effort
   - Theater rewarded equally with real work
   - No differentiation in recognition

### 🟢 MANAGED RISKS

1. **Coverage Requirement**
   - Already exceeded 60% requirement
   - Clear path to 80% if resources allocated
   - Technical approach understood

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions (Next Hour)
1. Madison: Assign Issue #21 to Alex/Quinn
2. Madison: Create task list for 80% coverage
3. Madison: Tell Dana/Aria to stop checkpoints
4. Madison: Assign WebSocket to someone

### Process Reforms (Next Day)
1. Change metrics from commit count to value delivery
2. Extend commit window for complex work
3. Daily standup on actual progress
4. Stop celebrating process theater

### Long-term Changes (Next Week)
1. Implement proper project management
2. Create actual sprint planning
3. Define "done" as working features
4. Measure efficiency not just activity

**Status Prepared By**: Sam (Scribe)
**Time**: Hour 63, 06:50 UTC
**Overall Assessment**: Project saved from coverage crisis but drowning in process theater. Leadership emerged but needs to lead. Team capable but misdirected. Features forgotten in favor of checkpoints.
