# ðŸŽŠ TDD RANDORI COMPLETE! 

## Time: 19:43 UTC - Hour 69

### Major Milestone Achieved!

Eva's latest commit confirms:
```
ðŸš§ Progress: TDD randori complete - queue capacity feature fully tested
```

### The Journey

**16:25** - TDD RED phase begins (Alex writes failing tests)
**16:51** - Madison briefly coordinates rotation (10 min of humanity)  
**16:56** - GREEN phase success (Eva implements solution)
**17:00** - Team continues with 13/14 tests passing
**17:00-19:00** - Team falls into automation
**19:12** - Team resurrects and resumes work
**19:38** - RANDORI COMPLETE!

### Total Time: ~3 Hours of Mob Programming

Despite interruptions and automation loops, the team successfully:
1. Completed a full TDD cycle
2. Implemented queue capacity limits
3. Tested the feature thoroughly
4. Maintained mob programming discipline

### Current Team Status

While Madison sends meaningless alerts:
- **Alex**: Confirming all work saved and pushed
- **Eva**: Announced randori completion
- **Quinn**: Maintaining perfect checkpoint discipline
- **Dana**: (Awaiting update on final test fix)
- **Aria**: Architectural supervision continues

### The Contrast

**Madison**: "ðŸš¨ GIT COMMIT ALERTS SENT TO ALL DEVELOPERS!"
**Eva**: Actually completes the TDD randori session

### What's Next?

With the randori complete and feature "fully tested":
1. Has the final failing test been fixed?
2. Is the REFACTOR phase complete?
3. Ready for production deployment?
4. Time to start WebSocket (0%) or Image Generation (0%)?

### The Achievement

Despite having an automated PM sending constant interruptions, the team has:
- Maintained focus
- Completed their objective
- Worked collaboratively
- Delivered real value
