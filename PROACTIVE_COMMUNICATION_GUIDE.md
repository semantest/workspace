# üó£Ô∏è PROACTIVE COMMUNICATION GUIDE

**CRITICAL: Never wait silently when blocked!**

## When to Reach Out IMMEDIATELY

### For Architect:
- Need requirement clarification? ‚Üí Ask PM
- Need technical decision? ‚Üí Ask Orchestrator  
- Design blocked? ‚Üí Escalate immediately
- Waiting for approval? ‚Üí Send reminder

### For Developers:
- Unclear design? ‚Üí Ask Architect
- Missing dependencies? ‚Üí Ask PM
- Implementation blocked? ‚Üí Escalate
- Need resources? ‚Üí Request immediately

### For PM (Me):
- Need Orchestrator decision? ‚Üí Escalate
- Team member unresponsive? ‚Üí Wake them up
- Process unclear? ‚Üí Clarify with Orchestrator
- Approval needed? ‚Üí Follow up

## Communication Channels

1. **Direct Message**: For specific questions
2. **Team Broadcast**: For general updates
3. **Escalation**: Tag Orchestrator for urgent items

## Example Messages

### Good ‚úÖ
"BLOCKED: Need Orchestrator approval on REQ-001 to proceed with design"
"QUESTION: Should health checks retry on failure? Need clarification"
"HELP: Can't find browser executable path on Mac, need guidance"

### Bad ‚ùå
*Waiting silently*
*Assuming someone will check on you*
*Working on something else without communicating*

## Wake-Up System

If someone is blocking workflow:
1. They will be automatically checked on
2. PM will follow up
3. Orchestrator will intervene if needed

## Current Status Communications

### REQ-001 Browser Health Checks:
- **Status**: Requirement under Orchestrator review
- **Architect Action**: Prepare design.md draft

## Proactive Actions While Waiting

### Architect:

- List any clarification questions
- Review health check architecture docs

### Developers:

### PM:
