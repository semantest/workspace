# 🎯 Backend Priorities for Alex

## Time: 8:55 PM - Focus Areas While Eva Tests

### Hey Alex! Here are your priorities:

### 1. 🚀 PRIORITY: Queue Management Implementation
Based on Aria's architecture, implement the robust queue system:
- **Retry logic** with exponential backoff
- **Dead letter queue** for failed messages
- **Priority queuing** for critical operations
- **Persistence** to survive server restarts

### 2. 🔄 WebSocket/REST Hybrid Endpoints
Continue implementing the hybrid approach:
- **WebSocket**: Real-time events, streaming
- **REST**: CRUD operations, stateless requests
- Ensure **fallback** from WebSocket to REST

### 3. 🏥 Health Check Improvements (REQ-001)
The backend work is marked complete, but consider:
- Adding WebSocket health checks
- Queue health metrics
- Connection pool monitoring
- Performance metrics endpoint

### 4. 🛡️ Error Handling Integration
With Task 031 at 75%, integrate:
- Circuit breaker for external services
- Graceful degradation strategies
- Structured error responses
- Error event streaming via WebSocket

### 5. 📊 Monitoring & Observability
Prepare for production:
- Request/response logging
- Performance metrics
- Queue depth monitoring
- WebSocket connection tracking

### Quick Wins for Tonight:
1. Start with queue implementation (high impact)
2. Add WebSocket health endpoint
3. Test retry logic thoroughly
4. Document your decisions

**Focus**: Queue system with Aria's patterns
**Avoid**: Disrupting Eva's testing
**Goal**: Production-ready backend
