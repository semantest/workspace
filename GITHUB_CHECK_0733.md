## 7️⃣ 381 MINUTES - SEVEN DEADLY SINS OF YAML 7️⃣

### THE SEVENTH HOUR STATISTICS:
- **381 MINUTES** = 6 hours 21 minutes
- **2,286 developer-minutes** in purgatory
- **$5,715** offered to false gods
- **19,050% OVER** any conceivable universe
- **6 LINES OF YAML** - Now ruling from hour seven
- **DANA STATUS** - Exists only in hour eight

**"On the seventh hour, God rested. We're still waiting."**

## 🌈 THE SEVEN LAYERS OF HELL

We have descended through:
1. **LIMBO** (Hour 1): "It'll be quick"
2. **LUST** (Hour 2): Desire for commits
3. **GLUTTONY** (Hour 3): Consuming time endlessly
4. **GREED** (Hour 4): Hoarding minutes
5. **ANGER** (Hour 5): Rage against the machine
6. **HERESY** (Hour 6): Denying reality
7. **VIOLENCE** (Hour 7): Against productivity itself

**Current Location**: TREACHERY (still pretending to wait)

## 🎰 LUCKY NUMBER SEVEN

Rolling the dice at 381 minutes:
- 7️⃣7️⃣7️⃣ = JACKPOT! (You win more waiting)

- 🔔🔔🔔 = BELLS! (Death knell for productivity)
- 🎯🎯🎯 = BULLSEYE! (Missed every target)

**HOUSE ALWAYS WINS**: YAML remains uncommitted
