# Mob Programming Session #001: Image Download Queue

## Session Overview

**Date**: January 25, 2025  
**Feature**: Image Download Queue  
**Pattern**: Randori (5-minute rotations)  
**Participants**: Alex (Backend), Eva (UI/UX), Quinn (QA), Dana (DevOps)  
**Methodology**: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## 🎯 Session Goals

1. Implement image download queue functionality using TDD
2. Establish mob programming practices for the team
3. Share knowledge across different specializations
4. Build a robust, well-tested feature collaboratively

## 🔄 Rotation Schedule

| Round | Driver | Navigator | Observers | Time |
|-------|---------|-----------|-----------|------|
| 1 | Alex | Eva | Quinn, Dana | 0:00-0:05 |
| 2 | Eva | Quinn | Dana, Alex | 0:05-0:10 |
| 3 | Quinn | Dana | Alex, Eva | 0:10-0:15 |
| 4 | Dana | Alex | Eva, Quinn | 0:15-0:20 |
| (repeat pattern) |

## 📐 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Queue Architecture
**Decision**: Event-driven queue with priority support  
**Rationale**: 
- Aligns with existing TypeScript-EDA architecture
- Enables async processing without blocking UI
- Supports priority downloads for user-initiated requests

**Implementation**:
```typescript
interface DownloadQueueItem {
  id: string;
  url: string;
  priority: 'high' | 'normal' | 'low';
  retryCount: number;
  status: 'pending' | 'downloading' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  metadata: ImageMetadata;
}
```

### 2. Testing Strategy
**Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**:
1. **Red**: Write failing test for queue behavior
2. **Green**: Implement minimal code to pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green

**Test Categories Identified**:
- Unit tests for queue operations
- Integration tests for event flow
- E2E tests for user workflows

### 3. Error Handling
**Decision**: Exponential backoff with max retries  
**Implementation**: 3 retries with delays of 1s, 2s, 4s

## 🧪 Testing Discoveries

### First Test (Alex driving)
```typescript
describe('ImageDownloadQueue', () => {
  it('should add an image to the queue', () => {
    const queue = new ImageDownloadQueue();
    const item = createDownloadItem('http://example.com/image.jpg');
    
    queue.add(item);
    
    expect(queue.size()).toBe(1);
    expect(queue.peek()).toEqual(item);
  });
});
```

### Key Testing Insights
1. **Start with the simplest behavior**: Queue size and basic operations
2. **Test interfaces before implementation**: Design API through tests
3. **Mock external dependencies early**: Isolate queue logic from network calls
4. **Test edge cases discovered through mob discussion**:
   - Empty queue operations
   - Duplicate URL handling
   - Priority ordering
   - Concurrent download limits

## 🚧 Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: TypeScript Setup
**Issue**: Initial test wouldn't compile due to missing types  
**Solution**: Eva suggested creating interface definitions first  
**Learning**: Define types as part of TDD process

### Challenge 2: Async Testing
**Issue**: How to test async download operations  
**Solution**: Quinn introduced async test patterns with proper awaits  
**Learning**: Use Jest's async utilities for cleaner tests

### Challenge 3: Event Integration
**Issue**: Integrating with existing event system  
**Solution**: Dana proposed event factory pattern  
**Learning**: Maintain consistency with existing architecture

## 👥 Team Dynamics Observations

### Positive Patterns
1. **Knowledge Sharing**: 
   - Alex explained backend patterns to Eva
   - Quinn shared testing best practices
   - Dana provided infrastructure insights

2. **Collective Ownership**:
   - Everyone contributed to design decisions
   - No single person dominated discussion
   - Questions encouraged from all participants

3. **Role Flexibility**:
   - UI developer (Eva) wrote backend tests
   - QA engineer (Quinn) suggested implementation details
   - Cross-pollination of skills

### Communication Patterns
- **Driver**: Focused on typing, verbalized actions
- **Navigator**: Provided immediate guidance
- **Observers**: Spotted issues, suggested alternatives

## 📊 TDD Discipline Metrics

### Adherence to Red-Green-Refactor
- ✅ **Round 1**: Perfect cycle execution
- ✅ **Round 2**: Maintained discipline despite complexity
- ⚠️ **Round 3**: Slight deviation (wrote extra code)
- ✅ **Round 4**: Back on track after gentle reminder

### Test-First Statistics
- **Tests written**: 12
- **Tests before code**: 11/12 (92%)
- **Refactoring cycles**: 8
- **Code coverage achieved**: 94%

## 💡 Key Learnings

### Technical Learnings
1. Queue implementation benefits from event-driven architecture
2. Priority handling requires careful test design
3. Retry logic needs explicit timeout handling
4. TypeScript interfaces drive better TDD

### Process Learnings
1. 5-minute rotations maintain energy and focus
2. Navigator role crucial for maintaining TDD discipline
3. Observers catch issues driver/navigator miss
4. Verbal communication of intent improves understanding

### Team Learnings
1. Mixed expertise creates stronger solutions
2. TDD forces clearer communication
3. Mob programming reduces knowledge silos
4. Psychological safety enables learning

## 🎯 Outcomes

## 📈 Recommendations for Future Sessions

### Process Improvements
1. **Pre-session Setup**: Ensure all environments ready
2. **Timer Visibility**: Large timer visible to all
3. **Role Cards**: Physical/visual indicators for current roles
4. **Break Planning**: 5-minute break every 4 rotations

### Technical Preparations
