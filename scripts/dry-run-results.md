# Task 005: Migration Dry-Run Results

**Time**: 14:48 CEST  
**Branch**: feature/005-execute-migration  
**Script**: scripts/migrate-buddy-to-semantest.ts  

## Summary

Attempted to run the migration script in dry-run mode to preview changes before actual execution.

## Technical Issues Encountered

### TypeScript Compilation Errors
- The migration script has TypeScript configuration issues
- Unable to execute with ts-node due to module resolution problems
- Compilation errors related to target ES version settings

### Attempted Solutions
1. Direct ts-node execution - Failed with type errors
2. Node --loader approach - Failed with module cycle error
3. Direct tsc compilation - Failed with ES2015 target requirements

## Expected Changes (Based on Mapping)

According to `replacement-mapping.json`, the migration would affect:
- **2,380 total occurrences** across 184 files
- **Simple replacements**: 1,613 occurrences (67.8%)
- **Context-aware**: 254 occurrences (10.7%)
- **Manual review needed**: 159 occurrences (6.7%)

### Protected Patterns
The following security-sensitive patterns would be preserved:
- WEB_BUDDY_API_KEY
- WEBBUDDY_SECRET
- WEB_BUDDY_TOKEN
- And 10 other security exclusions

## Next Steps

1. **Fix TypeScript Configuration**: Add proper tsconfig.json with ES2015+ target
2. **Re-run Dry Mode**: Execute with fixed configuration
3. **Review Output**: Validate all changes before live execution
4. **Execute Migration**: Run without --dry-run flag

## Recommendation

Before proceeding with actual migration:
1. Fix the TypeScript compilation issues
2. Add a proper tsconfig.json to the scripts directory
3. Test the migration on a small subset first
