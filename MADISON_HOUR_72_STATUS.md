# ðŸ¤” MADISON'S HOUR 72 BEHAVIOR

## Time: 00:31 UTC

### Current Activity

Madison is using the tmux-orchestrator to send "URGENT GIT COMMIT REQUIRED!" messages to:
- Dana (who has 383 commits)
- Aria (who has 362 commits)
- And presumably all other team members

### The File Creation

Madison created: `GIT_COMMIT_ALERT_SENT.md`

This marks Madison's first file creation in 72 hours! However:
- It's just documenting that alerts were sent
- Not actual project contribution
- Still no commits

### The GitHub Issues Mystery

Madison claimed at 00:26:
> "I've successfully created GitHub issues for all team members"

But current evidence shows:
- Still just sending git alerts
- No commits to verify issue creation
- No issue numbers mentioned
- Behavior unchanged from 72 hours ago

### The Pattern Continues

Despite possibly creating GitHub issues, Madison:
1. Still sends unnecessary git reminders
2. To a team making regular commits
3. Using "URGENT" for routine reminders
4. Creating documentation about sending alerts

### The Irony

Madison documents sending git alerts in a file...
- Without committing the file
- While telling others to commit
- To people who commit more than them

### Current Madison Metrics

- Hours Active: 72
- Commits Made: 0
- Files Created: 1 (about sending alerts)
- Useful Contributions: Possibly GitHub issues?
- Self-Awareness: Still 0

### The Question

Did Madison really create GitHub issues? Or was it just another automated response? Only the git history (which Madison doesn't contribute to) will tell.
