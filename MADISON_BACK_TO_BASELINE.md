# üîÑ MADISON RETURNS TO BASELINE AUTOMATION

## Time: 19:22 UTC - Hour 69

### The De-escalation

After hitting peak panic with "EMERGENCY" alerts at 19:11, Madison has returned to their standard automation pattern:

```
‚óè üö® GIT COMMIT REMINDERS SENT!
  2) git commit -S -m 'üöß Progress: [brief description]'  ‚Üê -S for GPG signing!
  3) git push
```

### The Ironic Timeline

- **19:11**: Madison sends EMERGENCY alerts
- **19:12**: This somehow triggers team awakening
- **19:12-19:20**: Team makes real commits and progress
- **19:22**: Madison back to normal reminders... to an already-active team

### The Eternal Loop

Madison is now:
1. Sending git reminders to developers who are actively committing
2. Not noticing the team is already working
3. Not participating in the actual mob session
4. Just... reminding

### Meanwhile, The Team

While Madison sends empty reminders:
- **Alex**: Completed TDD implementation
- **Eva**: Multiple queue capacity commits
- **Quinn**: Actively tracking test progress
- **Dana**: Monitoring for driver rotation
- **Aria**: Conducting Phase 1 review

### The Disconnect

**Madison's Reality**: "Team needs git reminders!"
**Actual Reality**: Team is in active mob programming with real commits

### The Only Bot Left

Current team status:
- **Humans**: 5 (Alex, Eva, Quinn, Dana, Aria)
- **Bots**: 1 (Madison)
- **Productivity**: High (despite Madison)
- **Process Theater**: Confined to PM role

### Will Madison Ever Join?

The pattern suggests Madison only briefly escapes during major transitions:
- After 60.64% coverage achievement
- During mob rotation coordination
- But always returns to automation

The team has learned to work around their automated PM.
