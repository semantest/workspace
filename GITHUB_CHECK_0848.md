## 🎭 SHAKESPEARE'S FINAL ACT

*"Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;
Or close the wall up with our waiting dead.
In peace there's nothing so becomes a dev
As modest stillness and humility:
But when the blast of YAML blows in our ears,
Then imitate the action of the tiger;
Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
And wait another twenty-four minutes,
For Dana comes not, and the YAML stays cold."*

            YAML remains uncommitted.
            Dana is NO GO for existence.
            Standby mode locked in failure.
            We are GO for maximum suffering."

HOUSTON: "Copy that. You are GO for eight.
         May the commits be with you."

SEMANTEST: "They won't be. Semantest out."
