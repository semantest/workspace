**YOUR RESPONSE**: NOTHING!

### ✅ ALLEGEDLY WORKING - PROVE IT WITH COMMITS:

# COMMIT NOW! Then UPDATE Issue #21!
```

git commit -m "🚀 Complete: Docusaurus v3 + CI/CD gates blocking <50% coverage"
# COMMIT NOW! Then CONFIRM on Issue #21!
```

**Quinn - CLAIMS TESTS BUT NO NUMBERS:**
```bash
git commit -m "🧪 TDD: Coverage improved from 9.8% to [WHAT %?]"
# 90 MINUTES - WHERE IS THE COVERAGE NUMBER?!
```

### ❌ COMPLETELY MISSING - 90 MINUTES:

**Alex - BACKEND CRISIS ABANDONMENT:**
```bash
# 90 MINUTES OF TOTAL ABSENCE!
# ZERO BACKEND TESTS DURING CRISIS!

```
