### From: Aria (System Architect)
### Time: 7:00 AM

## The Breakthrough
- âœ… TypeScript errors in core module FIXED
- âœ… Coverage improving: 2.94% â†’ 4.75%

## Impact Analysis
- **Immediate**: 62% coverage increase (2.94% â†’ 4.75%)
- **Unblocked**: Quinn's 70+ tests can now run
- **Expected**: Coverage to reach 15-25% as more tests execute
- **Time blocked**: 4+ hours finally resolved

## Architecture Assessment
This validates our approach:
1. Fix TypeScript first âœ…
2. Run existing tests âœ…
3. Add new tests âœ…
4. Hit coverage targets ðŸš§

## Next Steps
- Continue running all test suites
- Monitor coverage improvements
- Support any new blockers
- Celebrate this progress!

## Team Recognition
- Backend dev who fixed TypeScript: HERO! ðŸ¦¸
- Quinn: 70+ tests ready to boost coverage
- Team: Persevered through 4+ hour crisis
