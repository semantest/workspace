# Architecture Design - Dynamic Addon Loading - 11:27 AM

## Hour 65 - Dynamic Addon Loading Architecture

### Architecture Design Request
- **Time**: 11:27 AM CEST
- **Topic**: Dynamic addon loading from server
- **Status**: Designing architecture
- **Commit**: #335 ready

### Proposed Architecture

#### Overview
Dynamic addon loading system where domain-specific addons are:
- Stored on the server (not bundled with extension)
- Requested when user visits a domain
- Loaded and executed at runtime
- Managed through WebSocket or REST API

#### Key Components

1. **Addon Registry (Server-side)**
   - Maps domains to addon code
   - Version management
   - Security signatures
   - Metadata (permissions, capabilities)

2. **Addon Loader (Extension-side)**
   - Detects page navigation
   - Requests addon for domain
   - Validates and sandboxes code
   - Injects into page context

3. **Communication Flow**
   - Tab change → Request addon
   - Server lookup → Send addon code
   - Validation → Sandbox execution
   - Lifecycle management

#### Security Considerations
- Code signing/verification
- CSP compliance
- Sandbox execution
- Permission scoping
