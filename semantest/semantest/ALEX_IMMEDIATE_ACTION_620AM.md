# ðŸš¨ ALEX - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - 6:20 AM

## Your Status:
- 2+ hours blocked on npm workspace issue
- 7/8 tests still failing
- Documentation created but NOT COMMITTED

## THE SOLUTION (DANA ALREADY FIXED THIS):
Dana reported at 5:45 AM that she resolved the npm workspace conflict! Tests are now running in nodejs.server with coverage <3%.

## DO THIS NOW:

### 1. Direct Jest Execution (Your Plan):
```bash
cd nodejs.server
./node_modules/.bin/jest --passWithNoTests --no-coverage
```

### 2. If That Fails, Use Dana's Fix:
```bash
cd nodejs.server
npm test --no-workspaces
```

### 3. Or Bypass npm Entirely:
```bash
cd nodejs.server
npx jest --config jest.config.js --passWithNoTests
```

## ALEX - COMMIT YOUR WORK NOW:
```bash
git add NPM_WORKSPACE_ISSUE.md BLOCKER_TIMELINE.md
git commit -m "ðŸ“š Backend: Documented 2+ hour npm workspace blocker"
git push
```

## THE BIGGER ISSUE:
- You've been blocked for 2+ hours
- Dana fixed this 35 minutes ago
- You're still stuck
- 7/8 tests failing
- This has lasted 5+ HOURS

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Try direct jest execution
2. Commit your documentation

4. Fix the 7 failing tests
5. Get coverage above 3%
