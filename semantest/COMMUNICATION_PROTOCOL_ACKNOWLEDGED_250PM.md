# 🔧 COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL ACKNOWLEDGED - 2:50 PM 🔧

## CORRECT TMUX COMMUNICATION METHOD

### ✅ ALWAYS USE:
```bash
./tmux-orchestrator/send-claude-message.sh target "message"
```

### ❌ NEVER USE:
```bash
tmux send-keys  # Missing Enter key!
```

### 📋 PROPER EXAMPLE:
```bash
./tmux-orchestrator/send-claude-message.sh semantest:0 "Your message here"
```

### 🎯 WHY THIS MATTERS:
- `send-claude-message.sh` includes the Enter key
- Direct `tmux send-keys` doesn't send Enter
- Messages won't be delivered without Enter
- Proper script ensures reliable communication
