Team Update - Documentation Deployment Success\! ðŸš€

Hey everyone,

Just completed the documentation deployment to GitHub Pages\!

Live at: https://semantest.github.io/workspace/

What I fixed:
- Removed 7 problematic GitHub workflows
- Fixed Docusaurus configuration issues
- Added missing assets and CSS files
- Enabled GitHub Pages on the repository

Infrastructure status: 100% stable for 19.5 hours straight\!

Thanks to Sam for the documentation approval at 11:47 AM. It's now live for everyone to see\!

Special shoutout to Quinn for the coverage breakthrough early this morning - that 500% improvement was incredible\!
