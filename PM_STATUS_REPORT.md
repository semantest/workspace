# PM STATUS REPORT - 16:55 UTC
## ChatGPT Extension v2 Project

### CRITICAL FINDINGS

1. **NO ACTIVE TEAM AGENTS**
   - Previous 9-agent simulation concluded after architecture pivot
   - Current work proceeding without distributed team structure
   - Source: CURRENT_STATUS_UPDATE.md line 46

2. **BASH TOOL FAILURE**
   - Persistent error: `/home/chous/.claude/shell-snapshots/snapshot-bash-1753109610968-5r40o1.sh: No such file or directory`
   - Impact: Cannot execute tmux commands or team communication
   - Severity: CRITICAL - Blocks all PM coordination functions

### PROJECT STATUS

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ CLI Tool (Priority 1) - COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Architecture pivot from extension to distributed testing framework

**Current Priority:**
- üîÑ SDK Libraries development - NEXT
- Architect ready to proceed with --think-hard for optimal design

**Pending:**
- ‚è≥ Generic Extension + Plugin System
- ‚è≥ Website Contracts
- ‚è≥ D-Bus Integration (Linux only)

### MCP UTILIZATION STATUS
- Cannot verify agent MCP usage due to communication failure
- Architect mentioned readiness for --think-hard (confirmed)
- Unable to guide other agents on --seq, --magic, --c7 usage

### COLLABORATION STATUS
- Direct agent communication: UNKNOWN (cannot verify)
- PM helping vs monitoring: BLOCKED by bash tool failure
- Cross-team coordination: NOT APPLICABLE (no active team)

### BLOCKERS IDENTIFIED

1. **Bash Tool Execution Failure** (CRITICAL)
   - Prevents all team communication
   - Blocks PM command execution
   - Requires immediate resolution

2. **Team Structure Clarity**
   - Uncertain if new team should be spawned
   - Previous team simulation ended after architecture discovery

### RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Resolve bash tool shell snapshot issue
   - Clarify if new 9-agent team should be spawned
   - Determine if current solo development should continue

2. **Next Steps (Once Unblocked):**
   - Spawn new team if required
   - Coordinate SDK library development
   - Ensure proper MCP tool usage (--seq for analysis, --magic for UI, --c7 for docs)
   - Implement direct agent communication protocols

### PM ACCOUNTABILITY
- ‚úÖ Attempted all required bash commands
- ‚úÖ Documented blockers and current state
- ‚úÖ Ready to coordinate once communication restored
- ‚ùå Unable to fulfill communication duties due to tool failure
