# ðŸŽ‰ Dana - AWS Access Available!

## Great News!

rydnr has confirmed he can provide AWS credentials when you're ready to deploy!

## Updated Deployment Plan:

### Phase 1: Preparation (NOW)
1. **Focus on Pulumi code development**
   - Complete infrastructure as code
   - Test locally with Pulumi preview
   - Prepare all Lambda functions
   - Document resource requirements

### Phase 2: Deployment (When Ready)
1. **Request AWS credentials from rydnr**
   ```bash
   ./tmux-orchestrator/send-claude-message.sh semantest:0 @PM: Dana - Ready for AWS credentials
   ```

2. **rydnr will provide:**
   - AWS Access Key ID
   - AWS Secret Access Key
   - Appropriate IAM permissions
   - Any specific deployment constraints

### What This Means:
- âœ… **No blocker** on AWS access
- âœ… Focus on code quality first
- âœ… Deploy when fully ready
- âœ… No rush to request credentials

### Your Current Priority:
1. Complete Pulumi TypeScript code
2. Lambda function handlers
3. API Gateway configuration
4. Test with `pulumi preview`
5. THEN request AWS access

### Resources You'll Need (for rydnr):
When requesting access, provide estimated AWS resources:
- API Gateway (WebSocket)
- Lambda functions (3-4)
- Route 53 (DNS)
- ACM (SSL certificate)
- CloudWatch logs

This removes a major potential blocker! Focus on great code first, deployment second.

Let me know when you're ready for credentials!
