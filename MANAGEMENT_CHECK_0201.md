**CRITICAL**: 4/7 agents disconnected (blank screens)

## 2️⃣ MCP Superpower Usage

**ZERO ACTUAL USAGE** 🔴

## 4️⃣ BLOCKERS TO REMOVE

### 🔴 BLOCKER 1: Mass Agent Disconnection

## 🚨 EMERGENCY ACTIONS

1. **Agent Health Check**:
   - 4/7 agents appear fully disconnected
   - Need fresh spawn or reconnection

2. **Direct Implementation**:
   - PM continues fixing issues directly
   - Already did security + build fixes

3. **Test Execution**:
   - Run E2E tests for security
   - Test image workflow

4. **UI Creation**:
   - Create image upload component
   - Basic implementation sufficient
