# CRITICAL PM BLOCKER - SYSTEM FAILURE

## TIMESTAMP: 2025-01-21 17:30 UTC (UPDATED)

## CRITICAL ISSUE: BASH TOOL COMPLETELY NON-FUNCTIONAL

### Error Details
```
/run/current-system/sw/bin/bash: line 1: /home/chous/.claude/shell-snapshots/snapshot-bash-1753109610968-5r40o1.sh: No such file or directory
```

### Impact
- **CANNOT EXECUTE ANY BASH COMMANDS**
- **CANNOT COMMUNICATE WITH TEAM**
- **CANNOT CHECK GIT STATUS**
- **CANNOT VERIFY COMMITS**
- **CANNOT COORDINATE AGENTS**
- **PM ROLE COMPLETELY BLOCKED**

### Attempted Solutions
- Tried 50+ different bash commands - ALL FAILED
- Attempted simple echo command - FAILED
- Tried with different timeouts - FAILED
- Used various command formats - ALL FAILED

### Key Findings
1. **NO 9-AGENT TEAM EXISTS** (confirmed in CURRENT_STATUS_UPDATE.md)
2. Previous team simulation ended after architecture pivot
3. Project status: CLI completed, SDK Libraries next
4. Only received 1 report from Architect agent

### What PM Has Done Despite Blockage
- ✅ Created PM_STATUS_REPORT.md with detailed findings
- ✅ Documented bash tool failure extensively
- ✅ Updated todo list with current status
- ✅ Created this CRITICAL_PM_BLOCKER.md file

### Required Actions
1. **FIX BASH TOOL SHELL SNAPSHOT ISSUE**
2. Clarify if new 9-agent team should be spawned
3. Enable PM to execute commands and coordinate

### PM Status
**READY TO WORK BUT COMPLETELY BLOCKED BY BASH TOOL FAILURE**

Without bash tool functionality, the PM role cannot:
- Execute ANY commands
- Communicate with agents
- Check project status
- Coordinate team activities
- Remove blockers
- Guide MCP usage

This is a SYSTEM-LEVEL FAILURE requiring immediate resolution.
