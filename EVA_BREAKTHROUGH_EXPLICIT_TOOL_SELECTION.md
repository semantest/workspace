# ðŸ’¡ BREAKTHROUGH: Explicit Tool Selection Required

## Time: 7:39 PM - Critical Discovery by rydnr!

### The Problem:
- Sending 'A manga cat in space' to ChatGPT doesn't guarantee image generation
- ChatGPT might just describe it in text instead of generating an image
- Our extension was assuming ChatGPT would "understand" what we wanted

### The Solution:
Extension must explicitly:
1. **Click the 'Create image' tool** in ChatGPT interface
2. **Wait for DALL-E interface** to activate
3. **THEN inject the prompt**

### Impact:
- Changes approach from "hope ChatGPT understands" to "explicitly tell ChatGPT what tool to use"
- Should significantly improve reliability
- Eva is updating implementation now

### Technical Details:
- Need to locate and click the image generation tool button
- Must wait for UI state change before proceeding
- Ensures we're in the right mode before prompt injection
