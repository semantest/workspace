## 🔴 THE RULE OF SIXES

In 9 minutes, we achieve perfect hellish symmetry:
- **6** hours waited
- **6** lines of YAML
- **6** developers blocked
- **6** stages of grief
- **6** dimensions of failure
- **666** - The number we're approaching

## 💀 WHAT DIES AT SIX HOURS

1. **Mathematics** - 2 ≠ 360
2. **Logic** - Cause and effect severed
3. **Hope** - Already dead, but dies again
4. **Time** - Becomes circular
5. **Reality** - Optional after 360 minutes
6. **Everything** - Except the YAML

## 📊 THE FINAL EQUATION

```
Quick Fix Estimate: 2 minutes
Actual Time: 360 minutes
Efficiency: 2/360 = 0.556%
Cost: $5,400
Sanity: undefined
Dana: null
Success: ERROR_DIVIDING_BY_ZERO
```

## 🎺 THE APOCALYPSE SCHEDULE

**T-9 minutes**: Current position (documenting doom)
**T-8 minutes**: Reality starts glitching
**T-7 minutes**: Time becomes non-linear
**T-6 minutes**: The number 6 becomes sentient
**T-5 minutes**: YAML achieves consciousness
**T-4 minutes**: Dana paradox intensifies
**T-3 minutes**: Universal constants fail
**T-2 minutes**: Last chance to commit (won't happen)
**T-1 minute**: Final prayers to the void
**T-0**: SIX HOURS - UNIVERSE.EXE STOPS RESPONDING

## 🌋 EVERY DISASTER AT ONCE

We are experiencing:
- 🌋 Volcanic eruption of rage
- 🌊 Tsunami of despair  
- 🌪️ Hurricane of confusion
- ☄️ Meteor of inefficiency
- 🕳️ Black hole of productivity
- 💀 Death of everything
- 🦑 Cosmic horror awakening
- ⏰ Temporal paradox
- 🔥 And it's all on fire

## 🎭 THE FINAL PERFORMANCE

**"Six Hours for Six Lines: A Tragedy in 360 Acts"**

*NARRATOR*: "Once upon a time, 351 minutes ago..."
*CHORUS*: "It was supposed to be quick!"
*NARRATOR*: "But quick became eternal..."
*CHORUS*: "Where is Dana?!"
*NARRATOR*: "And eternal became legend..."
*CHORUS*: "Why won't it commit?!"
*NARRATOR*: "And legend became madness..."
*CHORUS*: "IÄ! IÄ! YAML FHTAGN!"
*NARRATOR*: "The end."
*YAML*: "No. The beginning."

## 🔮 THE SIXTH HOUR PROPHECY

*From the Book of Infinite Waiting, Chapter 360:*

"And on the sixth hour of the first day,
When the sun has witnessed the eternal shame,
When six lines remain uncommitted,
When Dana exists only in memory,
When standby mode has failed utterly,
Then shall the devs transcend mortality,
And become one with the eternal wait.
For it is written: Time is YAML, and YAML is suffering."

## 🎪 CIRCUS FINALE PREPARATION

**THE GREATEST SHOW IN THE ABYSS**

In 9 minutes witness:
- The Dev Team That Waited 6 Hours!
- The YAML That Wouldn't Commit!
- The Dana That Never Was!
- The Standby Mode of Doom!
- The Money That Burned!
- The Time That Died!

**ONE NIGHT ONLY** (That lasts forever)

## 💸 THE SIX HOUR ECONOMY

At 360 minutes:
- Cost: $5,400
- Value delivered: $0
- ROI: -∞%
- Cost per line: $900
- Cost per character: $45
- Cost per hope: Priceless (all hope dead)

## 🌅 DAWN'S FINAL JUDGMENT

The sun has risen fully and declares:
"I have seen many things in my billions of years.
I have witnessed the birth and death of civilizations.
I have seen empires rise and fall.
But never, in all my cosmic existence,
Have I seen someone wait 6 hours for a 2-minute fix.
This is unprecedented.
This is impossible.
This is... YAML."

## 📻 EMERGENCY BROADCAST

```
⚠️ EBS ALERT ⚠️ EBS ALERT ⚠️

THIS IS AN EMERGENCY BROADCAST

AT 07:12 AM CEST, THE SEMANTEST TEAM WILL ACHIEVE
SIX HOURS OF WAITING FOR A TWO-MINUTE FIX.

THIS EVENT MAY CAUSE:
- TEMPORAL ANOMALIES
- REALITY DISTORTIONS  
- MATHEMATICAL PARADOXES
- UNIVERSAL CONSTANTS FAILING
- THE END OF MEANING ITSELF

SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER IN COMMITTED REPOSITORIES.
AVOID ALL YAML FILES.
DO NOT LOOK FOR DANA.
PRAY TO YOUR PREFERRED DEITY.

THIS IS NOT A TEST.
9 MINUTES REMAIN.

⚠️ EBS ALERT ⚠️ EBS ALERT ⚠️
