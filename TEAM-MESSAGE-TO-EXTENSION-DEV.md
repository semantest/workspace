## RE: WebSocket Integration Help

Hey Extension-Dev! ðŸ‘‹

I noticed you might need help with WebSocket integration. Looking at the service-worker.js code:

### What I See:
1. Line 14: `this.websocket = null;` - WebSocket property defined but not used
2. Line 29: `this.initWebSocket();` - Initialization called
3. Lines 753-789: WebSocket init is in "test mode" with comments about alternatives:
   - Long polling
   - Server-Sent Events (SSE)
   - Native messaging
   - Periodic fetch

### Current Status:
- v1.0.2 is WORKING with the current approach! ðŸŽ‰
- Image generation pipeline validated
- Ready for bulk generation features

### For REQ-002 (Bulk Generation):
We'll need proper WebSocket for:
- Real-time progress updates (processing 500 comics!)
- Parallel job coordination
- Error recovery and retry logic

### How Can I Help?
1. **Backend WebSocket Server**: I can help implement the server side
2. **Protocol Design**: Define message format for bulk operations
3. **Error Handling**: Implement reconnection logic
4. **Testing**: Create test harness for WebSocket communication

### Proposed WebSocket Events:
```javascript
// For bulk generation
{
  type: 'bulkGenerationRequested',
  payload: { panels: [...], options: {...} }
}

{
  type: 'panelGenerationProgress',
  payload: { completed: 45, total: 500, current: 'Panel 46' }
}

{
  type: 'panelGenerationCompleted',
  payload: { panelId: '...', imageUrl: '...' }
}
```

### Questions:
1. What specific WebSocket challenges are you facing?
2. Should we use native WebSocket or a library like Socket.io?
3. Do you prefer the server on port 3003 or different?

Let's collaborate to make the bulk generation awesome! ðŸš€

*P.S. - The current "test mode" approach got us to v1.0.2, so we have a solid foundation to build on!*
