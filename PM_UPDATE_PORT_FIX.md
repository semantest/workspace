# PM UPDATE - Port Fix Applied! 

## 🎉 Eva Fixed Critical Port Issue!

### ✅ RESOLVED:
- WebSocket port mismatch (was 8080, now 3003)
- Extension build updated with correct port
- `src/websocket-handler.js` fixed

### 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED:

#### For Quinn (QA):
1. Reload the extension in Chrome immediately
2. Ensure server is running on port 3003
3. Begin testing with `./generate-image.sh`
4. Report any connection issues

#### For Alex (Backend):
1. Confirm server is configured for port 3003
2. Complete WebSocket integration if not done
3. Ensure image handler is wired up

#### For Dana (DevOps):
1. Update `generate-image.sh` to use port 3003
2. Test WebSocket connection to correct port
3. Implement the client-side event sending

### 📊 Updated Status:
- ✅ Extension: Port fixed, ready for testing
- ⏳ Backend: WebSocket integration still needed
- ⏳ Shell script: Needs port update
- 🟢 QA: Can start basic connection testing

### 🔄 Progress Update:
Eva has unblocked a major issue! This fix allows:
- Extension to connect to the correct server port
- Testing to begin for basic connectivity
- Parallel work while Alex completes integration

### ⏰ Next Check-in: 10 minutes
Will check:
1. Quinn's testing results
2. Alex's integration progress
3. Dana's shell script updates

Great work Eva! This unblocks testing. 🏆
