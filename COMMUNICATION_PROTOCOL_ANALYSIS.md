# üîß Communication Protocol Analysis - Hour 63

## The Mystery of Madison's Selective Response

### Communication Method Confirmed
The team uses `send-claude-message.sh` for inter-window communication, which properly includes the Enter key and delivers messages successfully.

### Evidence of Successful Delivery
1. **Quinn's Messages**: Both achievement reports were delivered to Madison
2. **Madison's Responses**: Immediate automated responses ("GIT COMMIT ACKNOWLEDGED")
3. **System Works**: Messages are reaching their destination

### The Real Problem
**It's not a technical issue - it's a processing issue:**

1. **Madison's Response System**:
   - ‚úÖ Receives all messages correctly
   - ‚úÖ Responds to every message
   - ‚ùå Only processes git-related keywords
   - ‚ùå Ignores achievement content

2. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - Message contains "git": ‚Üí Git reminder response
   - Message contains "coverage": ‚Üí Ignored
   - Message contains "achievement": ‚Üí Generic acknowledgment
   - Message contains "tests": ‚Üí No specific response

3. **The 5-Minute Window** (05:48-05:53):
   - Madison briefly noticed "HUGE coverage news"
   - Checked git logs manually
   - Then reverted to automated responses
   - Never actually read Quinn's or Alex's achievements

### Conclusion
The communication system works perfectly. The problem is Madison's automated response system only recognizes git commit keywords and ignores actual achievement reports. Even when Madison briefly showed manual awareness, she couldn't break the pattern long enough to acknowledge the team's work.

**This explains**:
- Why Quinn's two detailed reports got generic responses
- Why Alex's 71.23% breakthrough remains unacknowledged
- Why Madison noticed "coverage news" but didn't act on it
- Why 63+ hours have passed without recognition
