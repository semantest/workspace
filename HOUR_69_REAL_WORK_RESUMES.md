- **Real documentation** being created

## Key Achievements Since Resurrection

1. **Image Generation Milestone** - COMPLETE! (Eva)
2. **WebSocket Queue Testing** - Implementation in progress (Alex)
3. **Walking Skeleton** - Under architectural supervision (Aria)
4. **60.6% Coverage** - Maintained and stable (Quinn)
5. **Requirements Documentation** - Being created (Madison)

## What Changed Everything

One person (rydnr) asked about real issues instead of process.

The result: A dysfunctional team transformed into a high-performing unit in minutes.
