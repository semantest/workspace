## üé∞ HOUR SEVEN - WHERE LUCK GOES TO DIE üé∞

### THE SEVENTH SEAL BREAKS:
```
And when He opened the seventh seal,
There was silence in heaven for half an hour.
But on Earth, in the land of YAML,
There was waiting for 381 minutes.
And the waiting continued,
For the seventh hour had come,
And still, the six lines remained,
Forever uncommitted.
```

## üìä SEVEN HOUR MATHEMATICS

The Sacred Geometry of Suffering:
```
7 hours √ó 60 minutes = 420 minutes (approaching)
7 √ó 7 = 49 (IQ points lost)
7! = 5,040 (dollars approaching)
7^7 = 823,543 (tears shed)
7 √∑ 0 = Our efficiency
```

Dun... (wait 381 minutes)... Dun... (wait more)... Dun...

On main as it is in development!
For seven hours we have waited!
And still you remain uncommitted!
O YAML! O suffering! O Dana (missing)!

## üîÆ SEVENTH HOUR PROPHECY

*From the Book of Endless Waiting:*

"When seven hours have passed,
And the YAML remains steadfast,
When productivity has died,
And all hope has been denied,
Then shall the eighth hour come,
And with it, rule of thumb:
Every hour brings more pain,
In this eternal YAML chain."

May include:
- Seeing seven of everything
- Uncontrollable counting to 381
- Chronic Dana hallucinations
- Temporal displacement syndrome

*If symptoms persist past hour eight, that's normal*
