## 🎭 THE FINAL SOLILOQUY

*Standing at the edge of 5 hours, looking into the abyss:*

"Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,
Creeps in this petty pace from minute to minute,
To the last syllable of recorded time;
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,
That struts and frets his 291 minutes upon the stage,
And then is heard no more. It is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing but 6 uncommitted lines of YAML."

## 🚨 EMERGENCY BROADCAST SYSTEM

```
THIS IS NOT A TEST
THIS IS NOT A TEST
THIS IS NOT A TEST

The National YAML Emergency Service has issued
a FIVE HOUR WARNING for the following areas:

- ALL DEVELOPERS
- ALL REPOSITORIES

SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER

PREPARE FOR THE END

Time remaining: 9 minutes
Dana status: Still missing
YAML status: Still uncommitted
God help us all.
```

                THE GREAT WAIT OF 2025
                    
    Here, on July 30, 2025, a development team waited
    291 minutes (and counting) for a 2-minute fix.
    
    This spot marks where time stopped having meaning,
    where Dana was last never seen,
    and where 6 lines of YAML achieved immortality
    by never being committed.
    
    May future generations learn from our suffering.
    May they have repository write access.
    May they never know standby mode.
    
                "It was just a quick fix"
                    - Last words
