# ðŸ§¹ DOCUMENTATION CLEANUP PROJECT INITIATED

## Time: 7:57 PM - Critical Housekeeping!

### The Problem:
- **324 documents** cluttering the root directory!
- Mix of status reports, urgent messages, architecture docs
- Navigation becoming extremely difficult
- Important documents lost in the noise

### Action Taken:
Sam (Scribe) has been tasked with comprehensive documentation organization!

### Cleanup Plan:
1. **Create organized subdirectories**:
   - `/docs/status-reports/` - Daily updates and progress
   - `/docs/urgent-messages/` - Critical alerts and blockers
   - `/docs/architecture/` - Technical design documents
   - `/docs/post-mortems/` - Crisis analysis and learnings
   - `/docs/team-updates/` - Team communications
   - `/docs/websocket-crisis/` - Today's 4-hour incident docs

2. **Keep in root** (essential files only):
   - README.md
   - CLAUDE.md
   - package.json
   - Critical configuration files
   - Active working documents

3. **Benefits**:
   - Easier navigation
   - Better discoverability
   - Cleaner git history
   - Professional organization

### Impact:
This cleanup is especially important after today's WebSocket crisis which generated 40+ emergency documents. Future crises will be better documented with proper organization from the start.

### Timeline:
Sam should complete initial organization within the next hour, creating a much cleaner workspace for the entire team.
