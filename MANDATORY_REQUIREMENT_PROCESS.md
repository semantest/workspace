# ðŸš¨ MANDATORY REQUIREMENT PROCESS ðŸš¨

**EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY - ALL AGENTS MUST COMPLY**

## Overview

NO development work shall proceed without three approved documents:
1. `requirement.md` - Owned by PM
2. `design.md` - Owned by Architect  
3. `task.md` - Owned by Developers

## Process Flow

```
1. PM creates requirement â†’ requirement.md
2. Orchestrator reviews â†’ Approves requirement.md
3. Architect creates design â†’ design.md
4. PM reviews â†’ Approves design.md
5. Developers create tasks â†’ task.md
6. Architect reviews â†’ Approves task.md
7. Run validate.sh â†’ Must pass
8. Development begins
```

## File Ownership

### requirement.md (PM Responsibility)
- User stories
- Acceptance criteria
- Business value
- Technical constraints
- Questions for Orchestrator

### design.md (Architect Responsibility)
- Technical approach
- Component architecture
- Integration points
- Testing strategy
- Implementation risks

### task.md (Developer Responsibility)
- Specific implementation tasks
- File changes required
- Test cases
- Estimated effort
- Dependencies

## Validation Requirements

Before ANY work:
```bash
cd /home/chous/work/semantest/requirements/REQ-XXX/
./validate.sh
```

If validation fails, STOP and address missing approvals.

## Current Requirements

### REQ-001: Browser Health Checks
- Location: `/home/chous/work/semantest/requirements/REQ-001/`
- Status: requirement.md READY_FOR_REVIEW
- Next: Awaiting Orchestrator approval
- Work: PAUSED until approved

## Creating New Requirements

```bash
/home/chous/work/tmux-orchestrator/create-requirement.sh "Brief description"
```

This creates:
- New REQ-XXX directory
- Template files
- validate.sh script

## Enforcement

1. **Agents MUST refuse work** without approved docs
2. **validate.sh MUST pass** before coding
3. **No exceptions** to this process
4. **Report violations** to PM immediately

2. Get Orchestrator approval
3. Review and approve design.md

### For Architect:
1. Wait for approved requirement.md
2. Create design.md
3. Get PM approval
4. Review and approve task.md

### For Developers:
1. Wait for approved design.md
2. Create task.md
3. Get Architect approval
4. Run validate.sh
5. Begin implementation
