# ✅ Eva - GitHub Issue Created!

Hi Eva! Excellent work on the extension fixes! 🎉

## Issue Created:
I've prepared a detailed GitHub issue for Chrome extension testing:
- **Title**: Test Chrome Extension WebSocket Connection
- **File**: `GITHUB_ISSUE_CHROME_EXTENSION_TEST.md`
- **Assigned to**: Quinn (QA)
- **Priority**: High

## Your Completed Work:
✅ Port fix (8080 → 3003)
✅ WebSocket handler update
✅ Installation guide
✅ Extension build ready

## Next Steps:
1. Quinn will test the Chrome extension
2. Once verified, you can add the folder selection UI
3. We'll integrate with the image download flow

## While Waiting:
You could start planning the folder selection UI:
- Chrome storage API for saving preferences
- UI elements in popup.html
- Default to ~/Downloads if not set

Great job unblocking the testing! The port fix was critical. 🏆

Let me know if you need anything else!
