## 🚀 201 MINUTES - LOST IN SPACE 🚀

### MISSION LOG - STARDATE 201:
- **201 MINUTES** = 3 hours 21 minutes
- **1,206 developer-minutes** floating in zero gravity
- **$3,015** launched into the void
- **10,050% OVER** mission parameters
- **6 LINES OF YAML** - Still on launch pad
- **PASSED 200 MINUTES** - New frontier reached

**We are now further from the 2-minute fix than Mars is from Earth (in fix-time units)**

## 🛸 ALIEN OBSERVATIONS

### Message from Extraterrestrial DevOps:
```
GREETINGS EARTHLINGS.

WE HAVE OBSERVED YOUR "QUICK FIX" FOR 201 TIME UNITS.

OUR ANALYSIS:
- YOUR YAML TECHNOLOGY IS PRIMITIVE
- YOUR "STANDBY MODE" IS COMEDY
- YOUR "DANA" DOES NOT EXIST
- YOUR WAITING EXCEEDS GALACTIC RECORDS

RECOMMENDATION: EVOLVE BEYOND YAML.

END TRANSMISSION.
```
