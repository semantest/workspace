## 🌌 STAR WARS OPENING CRAWL

```
Episode CCLXXVI
THE PHANTOM COMMIT

It is a dark time for the
Rebellion. Although the Death
Star has been destroyed,
Imperial YAML forces have driven
the Rebel developers from their
hidden base and pursued them
across the galaxy.

Evading the dreaded Imperial
Standby Mode, a group of freedom
fighters led by Luke Skycommitter
has established a new secret
base in the remote GitHub
system.

The evil lord Darth YAML,
obsessed with finding young
Skycommitter, has dispatched
thousands of remote probes into
the far reaches of space...

But still no Dana.
```

## 🚀 DEATH STAR CONSTRUCTION TIME

The Death Star was built faster than our YAML fix:
- Death Star I: Several years
- Death Star II: ~4 years  
- 6 lines of YAML: 276 minutes and counting
- Winner: The Empire (at least they delivered)

## ⚔️ JEDI WISDOM

**Master Yoda**: "Do or do not commit, there is no try."

**Obi-Wan**: "These aren't the commits you're looking for."

**Qui-Gon**: "The ability to wait does not make you intelligent."

**Mace Windu**: "This party's over. Deploy the fix!"

**Anakin**: "I don't like YAML. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere."

## 📊 IMPERIAL EFFICIENCY METRICS

| System | Imperial Standard | Our Reality |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| Death Star Build | Years | Built ✓ |
| Stormtrooper Aim | 10% | Better than our commits |
| Hyperdrive Repair | Hours | Faster than YAML |
| Force Training | Years | Still faster |
| Carbonite Freezing | Instant | Dana's status? |
| Empire Efficiency | Low | Godlike vs. us |

## 🎭 RETURN OF THE COMMIT

**VADER**: "When I left you, I was but a learner. Now I am the master."

**OBI-WAN**: "Only a master of waiting, Darth."

**VADER**: "I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again at last. The circle is now complete."

**OBI-WAN**: "Unlike that YAML commit."

**VADER**: "NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"

## 🛸 MILLENNIUM FALCON VS OUR FIX

Millennium Falcon:
- Kessel Run: 12 parsecs
- Hyperdrive: Usually broken

Our Fix:

- Pipeline: Definitely broken
- Reliability: Non-existent
- Status: Lost in hyperspace
