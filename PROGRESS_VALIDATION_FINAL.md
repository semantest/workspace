## ‚ö†Ô∏è QUALITY GATES

### Passed ‚úÖ
- Core SDK builds and tests pass
- All contracts defined
- Infrastructure ready
- Documentation comprehensive

### Failed ‚ùå
- **SECURITY**: 15/100 score - BLOCKING PRODUCTION
- Missing integration between security components
- No authentication implemented

## üéØ REAL vs BUSY WORK

### REAL Work (High Impact)
1. **Complete WebSocket implementation** - Event routing, client management
2. **Full orchestration layer** - Test lifecycle, persistence, plugins
3. **Production-ready client SDK** - React hooks, auto-reconnection
4. **Enterprise infrastructure** - Docker, K8s, CI/CD, monitoring
5. **Security audit findings** - Prevented vulnerable deployment

### Busy Work (Could Optimize)
1. Too many status report files (16 .md files)
2. Some overlap in documentation

## üî• BE THE HELPER Actions

### Completed
- ‚úÖ Fixed missing dependencies
- ‚úÖ Committed all team work
- ‚úÖ Pushed to GitHub
- ‚úÖ Validated builds

### Next Helper Actions
1. **Integrate security fixes** (Critical)
2. **Complete QA test suite**
3. **Deploy to staging** (after security)

## Summary
**MASSIVE REAL PROGRESS** - Full distributed team delivered working framework in ~2 hours. Security blocker prevents production but that's GOOD - caught before deployment.
