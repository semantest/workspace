# ЁЯЪи GIT COMMIT REMINDER - URGENT!

## All developers must commit NOW:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -S -m 'ЁЯЪз Progress: [brief description]'
git push
```

## тЪая╕П CRITICAL: GPG Signing is MANDATORY!

The `-S` flag is required for all commits. This ensures commit authenticity.

## If you have GPG issues:

```bash
./tmux-orchestrator/gpg-signing-helper.sh YourName
```

Replace `YourName` with your actual name (Alex, Eva, Quinn, Sam, Dana, or Aria).

## Example commit messages:
- `ЁЯЪз Progress: Created requirements for dynamic addon loading`
- `ЁЯЪз Progress: Set up GitHub workflows structure`
- `ЁЯЪз Progress: Implemented event queue foundation`
- `ЁЯЪз Progress: Added test coverage for core module`
- `ЁЯЪз Progress: Enhanced documentation with storytelling`

## Why this matters:
1. **Synchronization** - Team-wide checkpoint
2. **Security** - GPG signing prevents impersonation
3. **Tracking** - Clear progress visibility
4. **Compliance** - Project requirements

## COMMIT NOW! This is a blocking operation for the entire team.
