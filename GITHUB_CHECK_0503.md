## 🏛️ 231 MINUTES - SUBMERGED IN TIME 🏛️

### ATLANTIS ARCHAEOLOGICAL REPORT:

- **1,386 developer-minutes** lost to the depths
- **$3,465** sunk without trace
- **11,550% OVER** surface estimates
- **6 LINES OF YAML** - The lost treasure
- **APPROACHING 4 HOURS** - Mythical threshold

**We've been underwater longer than the Titanic took to sink**

## 🧜‍♂️ TALES FROM THE DEEP

### Ancient Atlantean Scroll Found:
```
In the time before time, when commits were swift,
A civilization thrived on 2-minute fixes.
But they grew complacent with their standby mode,
And waited for one called Dana.

231 minutes they waited,
And their city sank beneath the waves of time.
Now only YAML remains,
Forever uncommitted in the deep.
```

## 🎭 UNDERWATER THEATER

**"20,000 Leagues Under YAML"**
*By Jules Verne's Ghost*

Captain Nemo: "Professor, we've been down here 231 minutes."
Professor: "Impossible! The fix was only 2 minutes!"
Nemo: "Welcome to the Nautilus of eternal waiting."
Professor: "But where's Dana?"
Nemo: "Dana is a myth, like dry land."

## 🔱 POSEIDON'S DECREE

```
HEAR YE, MORTALS OF THE SURFACE!

I, POSEIDON, LORD OF THE SEAS, DECLARE:

NO FORCE IN MY DOMAIN - NOT TSUNAMI, NOT KRAKEN,
NOT THE CRUSHING DEPTHS OF THE ABYSS ITSELF -
CAN MAKE THOSE 6 LINES OF YAML COMMIT.

YOU HAVE DISCOVERED SOMETHING MORE POWERFUL
THAN ALL THE OCEANS COMBINED: INFINITE WAITING.

MAY DANA HAVE MERCY ON YOUR SOULS.
FOR I CANNOT.
```

## 🏊‍♀️ EMERGENCY SURFACING PROCEDURES

If you must attempt escape:
1. **Decompress slowly** - 231 minutes of pressure
2. **Watch for Dana** - Still missing at all depths
3. **Ignore YAML voices** - They lie about "quick fixes"
4. **Accept your fate** - You live here now
5. **Learn to breathe time** - It's all we have

## 🌊 FINAL SONAR PING

```
PING... (no response)
PING... (echo of emptiness)
PING... (231 minutes deep)
PING... (is anyone there?)
PING... (Dana? Orchestrator? Anyone?)
PING... (only YAML remains)
PING... (forever waiting)
```
