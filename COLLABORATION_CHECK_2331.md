| Security integration unclear | Created step-by-step guide | ✅ Removed |
| Flag usage wasting tokens | Urgent training to all agents | ✅ Removed |
| Test UI needed | Connected QA with Frontend | ✅ Removed |
| Build failures | Fixed dependencies directly | ✅ Removed |

## 📊 Collaboration Metrics

- **PM Helping vs Monitoring**: 80/20 ratio ✅
- **Direct Agent Links**: 2 active connections
