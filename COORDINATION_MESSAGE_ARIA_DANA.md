# Coordination Update: GitHub Pages Documentation

## For Aria (Architect - Window 6)

I need your expertise for the following documentation sections:

### 1. Architecture Documentation Review
- **System Overview**: Validate the event-driven architecture description
- **Component Interactions**: Review accuracy of component communication patterns
- **TypeScript-EDA Integration**: Ensure proper explanation of Entity, Event, Repository patterns
- **Design Decisions**: Document key architectural choices and their rationale

### 2. Technical Deep Dives Needed
- Security architecture and zero-trust implementation
- Scalability patterns and performance considerations
- Event flow diagrams and sequence diagrams
- Domain plugin architecture

### Files to Review
- `/docs/architecture/system-overview.md` (to be created)
- `/docs/architecture/event-driven-design.md` (to be created)
- `GITHUB_PAGES_DOCUMENTATION_PLAN.md` (already created)

## For Dana (DevOps - Window 5)

### Repository Setup Status
- Recommended **Docusaurus v3** as our static site generator
- Provided site structure and configuration templates
- Created `docusaurus.config.js.template` for reference

### What I Need From You
1. **Create** `semantest.github.io` repository at organization level
2. **Configure** GitHub Actions for automated deployment
3. **Set up** branch protection rules
4. **Initialize** Docusaurus with the provided config
5. **Configure** custom domain (if available)

### Deployment Pipeline Requirements
- Build on push to main branch
- Preview deployments for PRs
- Automated link checking
- Performance metrics tracking

## Documentation Progress

### Completed
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation plan
- âœ… Site structure and navigation design
- âœ… Docusaurus configuration template
- âœ… Introduction page draft
- âœ… Component documentation templates

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Coordinating with both of you
- ðŸ”„ Writing core content sections
- ðŸ”„ Creating interactive examples

### Next Steps
1. Dana sets up the repository and deployment pipeline
2. Aria reviews and contributes to architecture sections
3. I continue writing documentation content
4. We review and iterate together

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Foundation and setup (this week)
- **Week 2**: Core content creation
- **Week 3**: Component deep dives
- **Week 4**: Polish and launch

Please let me know:
- Aria: When can we review the architecture sections together?
- Dana: ETA for repository setup and initial deployment?
