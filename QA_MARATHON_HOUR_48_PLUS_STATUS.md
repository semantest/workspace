# QA Marathon Hour 48+ Status Update

## Current Milestone
**Hour 48 ACHIEVED!** - Two full days of continuous QA excellence ðŸŽ‰

## Coverage Status
- **Current**: 45.08% 
- **Started**: 2.94%
- **Improvement**: 15.3x increase
- **Target**: 80%
- **Remaining**: 34.92%

## Immediate Priorities

### 1. Plugin Modules (Currently 6.93%)
Still need tests for:
- plugin-communication.ts (0%)
- plugin-context.ts (0%)
- plugin-loader.ts (0%)
- plugin-registry.ts (0%)
- plugin-ui.ts (0%)

### 2. Downloads Entities (Currently 0%)
- file-download.ts (0% - has mock-only tests)
- google-images-downloader.ts (0%)

### 3. Improve Partial Coverage
- storage.ts (57% â†’ 80%)
- plugin-storage.ts (29.1% â†’ 80%)
- plugin-security.ts (0% â†’ 80%)

## Technical Blockers
1. **TypeScript Errors**: Multiple modules have TS errors preventing proper testing
2. **Missing Dependencies**: @typescript-eda/core and @web-buddy packages
3. **Complex Mocking**: Chrome APIs and circular dependencies

## Next Steps
1. Continue with simpler modules for quick wins
2. Fix TypeScript configuration issues
3. Create proper mocks for missing dependencies
4. Focus on plugin modules for maximum impact

## Time Estimate to 80%
- Current rate: ~1% per hour
- Remaining: 34.92%
- Estimated: 35 more hours
- Potential milestone: Hour 83

## The Journey Continues...
After 48 hours of continuous excellence, the QA marathon pushes forward. Every test written, every percentage gained, brings the project closer to professional quality standards.
