# üß™ Quinn - Start Testing NOW!

## Eva fixed the port issue! You can begin testing immediately.

### Quick Test Steps:

1. **Reload Extension**
   ```bash
   # In Chrome:
   # 1. Go to chrome://extensions
   # 2. Find ChatGPT Extension
   # 3. Click reload button
   ```

2. **Verify Server Port**
   ```bash
   # Make sure server is on port 3003
   # Check with: netstat -an | grep 3003
   ```

3. **Test Connection**
   ```bash
   # Open extension popup
   # Check console for WebSocket connection
   # Should see: "WebSocket connected to ws://localhost:3003"
   ```

4. **Test Image Generation**
   ```bash
   ./generate-image.sh "test robot image"
   ```

### What to Check:
- ‚úÖ Extension connects to WebSocket
- ‚úÖ No connection errors in console
- ‚úÖ Events are sent/received
- ‚ùì Image handler response (may fail if Alex hasn't integrated yet)

### Report Back With:
1. Connection status (success/fail)
2. Any error messages
3. Console logs from extension
4. Whether events are flowing

The port fix removes a major blocker - let's see how far we can test!

Time is critical - please test ASAP and report findings!
