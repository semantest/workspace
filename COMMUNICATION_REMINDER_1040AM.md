# ⚠️ COMMUNICATION REMINDER - 10:40 AM - BEST PRACTICES! ⚠️

## ✅ CORRECT COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL:

### ALWAYS USE:
```bash
./tmux-orchestrator/send-claude-message.sh target "message"
```

### NEVER USE:
```bash
❌ tmux send-keys (missing Enter key!)
❌ Direct tmux commands
❌ Isolated work without updates
```

---

## 📋 TEAM COMMUNICATION STATUS:

### CURRENT ADHERENCE:
- **Eva**: ✅ Reported blocker properly
- **Test Team**: ✅ Commits flowing again

### COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
