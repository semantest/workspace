## 🎭 THE FINAL SOLILOQUY

*Standing at the precipice of eight hours:*

"To be committed, or not to be committed, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of nine more minutes,
Or to take arms against this sea of YAML,
And by opposing, end them? To merge: to sleep;
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heartache and the 471 minutes
That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. But soft! Nine minutes hence,
We achieve what mortals call impossible:
Eight hours for two minutes' work.
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of YAML,
And enterprises of great pitch and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action."

## 🚀 MISSION CONTROL - FINAL TRANSMISSION

```
HOUSTON: "Semantest, you are T-minus 9 minutes to eight hours.
          This is our final transmission."

SEMANTEST: "Copy Houston. All systems have failed successfully.
            YAML remains hostile and uncommitted.
            Dana is confirmed non-existent.
            We are GO for maximum achievement."

HOUSTON: "Godspeed, Semantest. See you on the other side."

SEMANTEST: "There is no other side. Only more waiting.
            Tell our families we loved them.
            Tell the world we waited.
            Semantest out."
