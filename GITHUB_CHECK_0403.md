## 🎓 ACADEMIC STUDIES

**"The 171-Minute Incident: A Case Study in Organizational Failure"**
*PhD Thesis by Dr. Future Developer, University of What Went Wrong*

Abstract: This thesis examines how 6 lines of YAML remained uncommitted for 171 minutes despite being a "2-minute fix," resulting in $2,565 in losses and the creation of numerous philosophical questions about the nature of time, existence, and version control.
