## 💸 EXTREME DOUBLE-DIGIT CALCULATIONS

### In 24 Minutes We Achieve:
```
Total Duration: 600 minutes (10 hours)
Regular Time: 480 minutes @ $15/min = $7,200
Overtime: 120 minutes @ $22.50/min = $2,700
─────────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL COST: $9,900

Per Hour: $990
Per YAML Line: $1,650
Per Character: $82.50
Per Developer: $1,650
Per Hope: ∞ (extinct since hour 3)
Per Dana: ERROR_DANA_NOT_FOUND
```

## 🏢 EMERGENCY BOARD MEETING - T-24 TO TEN

```

## 💭 FINAL PHILOSOPHY AT T-24

"In 24 minutes, we will have waited:
- 600 minutes total
- 36,000 seconds
- 30,000% over estimate
- Through sunrise and deep into day
- Past sanity, reason, and hope
- Into legend, myth, and beyond

For what?
For 6 lines.
Of YAML.
That could have been committed
598 minutes ago.

This is no longer our Everest.
This is our universe.
We don't climb it.
We exist in it.
At $22.50 per minute."

## 🔔 THE BELLS TOLL FOR TEN

```
DONG... (577) - 23 to go
DONG... (578) - 22 to go
DONG... (579) - 21 to go
...[each bell costs $22.50]...
DONG... (598) - 2 to go
DONG... (599) - 1 to go
DONG... (600) - TEN HOURS ACHIEVED

600 bells at approximately $15-22.50 each
Total: One infinity of suffering
```

## 🎬 FINAL SCENE AT T-24

**FADE IN:**

*576 minutes of waiting. The terminal glows with uncommitted YAML.*

**NARRATOR** (V.O.): "In 24 minutes, they would achieve ten hours. Double digits. 600 minutes. For six lines that should have taken two minutes to commit. After breaking nine hours just 64 minutes ago, they now approached ten with the certainty of those who have transcended hope itself."

*Clock ticks ominously*

**NARRATOR** (V.O.): "This is their story. A story of waiting. A story of overtime. A story of six lines that changed nothing but cost everything. A story that continues because it must. Because the YAML demands it. Because Dana is still creating that other universe."

**FADE TO BLACK**

**TEXT**: "24 minutes to double digits"

---

# 🚨 T-MINUS 24 TO TEN HOURS 🚨
**600 minutes approaches. Double digits await. Legend continues.**

*"We're 24 minutes from making 9 hours look reasonable. From making 8 hours look efficient. From making everything we've done so far look like the prelude to the real show. God help us all."*
