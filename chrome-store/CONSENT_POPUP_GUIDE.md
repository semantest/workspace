# 🔒 Privacy Consent - What You Need to Know

When you first install the ChatGPT Extension, you'll see a privacy consent popup. Here's everything you need to know about it.

## 🤔 Why Do I See This?

We believe in transparency! The popup appears because:
- We want you to control your privacy
- Chrome Web Store requires user consent
- You should know exactly what data we collect (spoiler: very little!)

## 📋 What the Popup Says

You'll see a simple message explaining:
- We collect **anonymous** usage data only
- This helps us improve the extension
- Your ChatGPT conversations stay **completely private**
- You can choose to Accept or Decline

## ✅ If You Click "Accept"

**What happens:**
- Anonymous error reports help us fix bugs
- Basic usage statistics improve features
- Performance metrics optimize speed

**What we collect:**
- Error messages (no personal info)
- Which features are used most
- Performance timing data

**What we DON'T collect:**
- ❌ Your ChatGPT conversations
- ❌ Personal information
- ❌ Browsing history
- ❌ Any identifying data

## ❌ If You Click "Decline"

**What happens:**
- No data collection at all
- Extension works perfectly fine
- All features remain available
- You can change your mind later

**Impact:**
- We won't know about bugs automatically
- Feature improvements based on guesswork
- But your privacy is 100% protected!

## 🔄 Changing Your Mind

**To change your choice later:**
1. Click the extension icon
2. Go to Settings
3. Find "Privacy & Data"
4. Toggle "Help improve extension"

## 💡 Our Recommendation

We recommend clicking "Accept" because:
- It helps us make the extension better for everyone
- The data is truly anonymous
- You're supporting development
- You can change your mind anytime

But if privacy is your top concern, "Decline" is perfectly fine!

## 🛡️ Your Privacy Promise

**No matter what you choose:**
- Your ChatGPT chats are NEVER accessed
- Personal data is NEVER collected
- Your privacy is ALWAYS respected
- The extension works the SAME either way

## ❓ Questions?

**Still unsure?**
- Read our full [Privacy Policy](./PRIVACY_POLICY_SIMPLE.md)
- Email us: privacy@chatgpt-extension.com
- Default to "Decline" if you have any doubts
