# 🛡️ Your Privacy is Protected - Our Robust Consent System

We've built multiple layers of protection to ensure your privacy choices are always respected.

## 🔒 How We Protect Your Privacy

### 1. **You'll Never Miss the Consent Request**
When you install the extension, we make sure you see the privacy choice:
- 🔔 Shows immediately on first install
- 🔄 If you close it, we'll ask again (every 30 seconds)
- ⏱️ We try for up to 5 minutes
- 📍 Always available in Settings if you miss it

### 2. **Your Choice is Remembered Forever**
Once you make a choice:
- ✅ It's saved permanently
- ✅ Works across all browser sessions
- ✅ No annoying repeated popups
- ✅ Change your mind anytime in Settings

### 3. **Multiple Safety Nets**
We've built fallbacks to ensure consent works:
- **Method 1**: Popup on installation
- **Method 2**: Check when you click the extension
- **Method 3**: Verify when you visit ChatGPT
- **Method 4**: Banner in Settings page

### 4. **Privacy-First Design**
```
If anything goes wrong → NO data collection
If you don't choose → NO data collection  
If you close popup → NO data collection
Only YOUR explicit choice → Enables data collection
```
