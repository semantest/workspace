### Key Decisions Made

1. **Continue REFACTOR phase** after TDD success
2. **Document coverage improvement** as team achievement
3. **Maintain mob programming** discipline
4. **Prepare for production deployment**

### Blockers Encountered

1. **Madison's Automation**: Continues but team works around it
2. **Issue #21**: Still unassigned (70+ hours)
3. **Driver Rotation**: Dana still waiting for turn
4. **Feature Priority**: No decision on WebSocket vs Image Generation

### Progress on Features

#### Queue Capacity ‚úÖ
- Status: COMPLETE
- Tests: 14/14 passing (100%)
- Coverage: Contributing to 60.72% overall
- Next: Deploy to production

#### WebSocket üî¥
- Status: 0% - Not started
- Blocker: Waiting for queue deployment
- Priority: Likely next feature

#### Image Generation üî¥
- Status: 0% - Not started
- Blocker: Waiting for WebSocket
- Priority: Third in queue

### Metrics Update

- **Test Coverage**: 60.64% ‚Üí 60.72% (+0.08%)
- **Commit Velocity**: ~1 every 5-10 minutes
- **Team Productivity**: 5/6 members active
- **Automation Time**: 0 (full hour productive!)
- **Madison Contributions**: 0

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Complete REFACTOR phase
2. **Next 30 min**: Deploy queue to production
3. **Hour 71**: Begin WebSocket implementation
4. **Ongoing**: Maintain consciousness, avoid automation
5. **Someone**: Please assign Issue #21!

### Hour 70 Analysis

This hour proves the team's capability when freed from automation:
- 40 minutes of sustained productivity
- Measurable improvements (coverage increase)
- Collaborative success (mob programming)
- High morale (victory commits)

The only shadow: Madison's continued automation, now using "BROADCAST" terminology while contributing nothing.

### Outlook for Hour 71

If the team maintains current momentum:
- Queue deployment likely
- WebSocket implementation could begin
- Coverage could reach 61%+
- Unless... automation returns

The pattern suggests 1-2 more hours of productivity before the next automation cycle. Let's hope the team breaks the pattern.
