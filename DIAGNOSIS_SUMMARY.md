# Diagnosis Summary

## What's Working ✅
1. Addon dev server is serving the bundle correctly
2. Extension loads and injects the addon into ChatGPT
3. Bridge is active and responds to ping messages
4. Service worker receives WebSocket messages
5. WebSocket server receives image generation requests

## What's Not Working ❌
1. Image generation events aren't reaching the service worker
2. When manually testing, the bridge works but addon doesn't respond

## The Issue
Looking at the service worker logs, I see:
- `🔍 Event type: system.connected` ✅
- `🔍 Event type: server.status` ✅
- But NO `🔍 Event type: semantest/custom/image/download/requested` ❌

This means the WebSocket server isn't forwarding the image events to the extension.

## Quick Test

### 1. In Service Worker Console
Copy and paste the entire contents of `test-message-flow.js`:
```javascript
// This will test the full message flow
// It will show exactly where the problem is
```

### 2. Expected Output
```
📋 Active tab: 280416094 https://chat.openai.com/...
✅ Bridge test passed: {success: true, message: 'pong'}
📤 Sending test image request...
✅ Message sent successfully: {received: true, bridge: 'active'}
```

### 3. In ChatGPT Console
You should see:
- `🌉 Bridge received from service worker`
- Debug messages from the addon

## The Real Problem

The WebSocket server shows "Unknown event type" which means it's receiving the event but not broadcasting it to connected extension clients. The server needs to forward these events to the extension.

## Workaround - Direct Test

While we fix the server forwarding, you can test the addon directly:

1. In the service worker console, run the test from `test-message-flow.js`
2. This bypasses the WebSocket server and sends directly to the addon
3. If this works, we know the addon is functional and just need to fix server forwarding
