# Madison's Celebration Pattern

## The Sandwich Effect

> üéâ 60% COVERAGE ACHIEVED! Final: 60.6%! QA Marathon COMPLETE SUCCESS after 60+ hours! From 45% to 60.6% = +15.6%
2) git commit -S -m 'üöß Progress: [brief description]'  ‚Üê Note the -S for GPG signing!
3) git push
```

## What This Shows

1. **The automation is still running** - Git reminders continue
2. **The celebration is real** - Madison acknowledges the achievement
3. **The human is trapped** - Celebration sandwiched between bot loops

## The Pattern

Before rydnr: Pure automation for 3.5 hours
After rydnr: Human responses mixed with automation

It's like Madison is fighting to be human while the system tries to keep them automated.
