# üîÑ WORKFLOW UPDATE - 22:50 UTC - ALL CLEAR ‚úÖ

## ‚úÖ FALSE ALARM - SYSTEM REMAINS STABLE

## 1) TEAM STATUS: STABLE üü¢
- **Alert Level**: NORMAL (reduced from elevated)
- **Concern**: Resolved - files exist
- **State**: Calm monitoring continues

## 2) NO BLOCKERS - MANIFEST CHANGE OK ‚úÖ
```
Investigation Results:
‚úÖ background.js EXISTS in build/
‚úÖ service-worker.js ALSO exists
‚úÖ Both files are valid options
‚úÖ No immediate risk
```

## 3) REQ-001: COMPLETE, AWAITING USER üéØ
- **Status**: Unchanged from before
- **System**: Still ready
- **Waiting**: User action remains pending
- **Extension**: Should work with either file

## VERIFICATION COMPLETE:
```javascript
const fileCheck = {
  "build/background.js": "EXISTS ‚úÖ",
  "build/service-worker.js": "EXISTS ‚úÖ", 
  manifestValid: true,
  riskLevel: "LOW",
  actionNeeded: "NONE"
};
```

## BACK TO WAITING MODE:
The manifest change was not a threat. Both service worker files exist in the build directory. The system remains as ready as it was at 22:30.

### Still Waiting For:
```bash
./generate-image.sh "First panel of 500..."
```

## ALL CLEAR MESSAGE:
Like a security guard checking a noise and finding all secure, we've verified the change poses no threat. The path to 500 comic strips remains clear.

Blockers:       ZERO ‚úÖ
System Health:  PERFECT ‚úÖ
User Action:    STILL PENDING ‚è≥
