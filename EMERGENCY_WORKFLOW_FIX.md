# 🚨 EMERGENCY: GitHub Workflows Fix Required 🚨

**Time**: Wed Jul 30 01:12:00 AM CEST 2025  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Reporter**: Dana (DevOps Lead)  
**Issue**: All workflows showing "No jobs were run"  

## 🔴 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED 🔴

Dana has identified critical workflow failures affecting CI/CD pipeline!

### 📊 Issue Summary

**Affected Workflows**:
- `enterprise-security.yml` - Job conditions failing for push/PR events
- `observability-stack.yml` - Missing push/PR triggers

**Impact**:
- ❌ No automated tests running
- ❌ No security scans
- ❌ No observability checks
- ❌ Blocking all deployments

### 🔧 Root Cause Analysis

1. **enterprise-security.yml**:
   - Current: Restrictive job conditions
   - Issue: Conditions evaluate to false on push/PR
   - Fix: Adjust conditions to include push/PR events

2. **observability-stack.yml**:
   - Current: Missing event triggers
   - Issue: Workflow never triggered
   - Fix: Add push and pull_request triggers

### ✅ Proposed Fix

```yaml
# enterprise-security.yml
jobs:
  security-scan:
    if: |
      github.event_name == 'push' || 
      github.event_name == 'pull_request' ||
      github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'

# observability-stack.yml  
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]
  workflow_dispatch:
```

### 🚀 Action Plan

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Create emergency PR with fixes
2. **TEST**: Verify workflows trigger correctly
3. **MERGE**: Fast-track through emergency process
4. **VALIDATE**: Confirm all jobs run successfully
