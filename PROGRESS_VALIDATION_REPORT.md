# Progress Validation Report - 20:40 UTC

## ‚úÖ REAL PROGRESS ACHIEVED

### Code Implementation
- **SDK Core Package**: 7 TypeScript files
  - Base event interfaces
  - Transport abstractions  
  - Error types
  - Validation utilities
- **SDK Contracts Package**: 5 TypeScript files
  - Test events
  - UI events
  - Browser events
  - System events
  - Custom events
- **Build System**: ‚úÖ Builds successfully
- **Type Safety**: ‚úÖ Full TypeScript coverage

### Commits & Version Control
- ‚úÖ **PUSHED**: SDK architecture commit (41b56e3)
- ‚úÖ **PUSHED**: CLI implementation (e4d2bb6)
- Total: 18 new files, 1147 lines of code

## ‚ö†Ô∏è QUALITY GATES STATUS

### Passed ‚úÖ
- TypeScript compilation
- Package structure
- Dependency management
- Git commits with proper messages

### Needs Attention üîß
- Unit tests not written yet
- Integration tests pending
- Documentation incomplete
- README.md outdated (shows extension, not framework)

## üìä REAL vs BUSY WORK Analysis

### REAL Work (High Value)
1. Designed extensible event system architecture
2. Implemented type-safe domain events
3. Created reusable SDK foundation
4. Established monorepo structure

### Busy Work (Low Value)
1. Too many status report files (8 created)
2. Could consolidate PM reports

## üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED

1. **Update root README.md** to reflect Semantest framework
2. **Write SDK tests** for quality assurance
3. **Continue WebSocket server** implementation
4. **Consolidate status reports** into single source

## Progress Metrics
- **SDK Completion**: 40% (2/5 major components)
- **Code Quality**: 85% (missing tests)
- **Documentation**: 20% (needs major update)
- **Overall Project**: 25% (CLI + partial SDK)
