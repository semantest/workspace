# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL LAUNCH BLOCKER: Telemetry Consent Verification

**Date**: January 21, 2025  
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Blocks Chrome Web Store Submission  
**Status**: UNRESOLVED  

## Issue Description
QA cannot test the telemetry consent popup due to lack of Chrome browser access. This popup is a **mandatory privacy requirement** for Chrome Web Store submission.

## Impact
- **Cannot submit to Chrome Web Store** without consent verification
- Privacy compliance requirement not met
- Launch sequence halted

## Current Status
- QA Team: No Chrome browser access
- Frontend: Contacted, awaiting response
- DevOps: Contacted, awaiting response  
- Engineer: Contacted, awaiting response

## Required Action
Need someone with Chrome browser to:
1. Install the extension locally
2. Trigger first-time setup
3. Verify telemetry consent popup appears
4. Test "Accept" flow
5. Test "Decline" flow
6. Verify settings are properly saved
7. Screenshot the consent dialog for documentation

## Potential Team Members Who Might Help
- **Architect**: May have development environment with Chrome
- **Security**: Likely has Chrome for security testing
- **Marketing**: Probably uses Chrome for web testing
- **UX Designer**: Should have Chrome for design testing
- **Scribe**: May have Chrome for documentation screenshots
- **Project Manager**: Could have Chrome for project management

## Test Steps Required
```yaml

5. Test "Accept" path:

   - Click Accept on consent
   - Verify telemetry is enabled
   - Verify setting saved as "accepted"
6. Verify consent can be changed in settings
```

## Resolution Priority
