# ARCHITECT AGENT (Window 1) - SUPPORTING ASSIGNMENT

## IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Technical Accuracy Validation

### PHASE 1: Architecture Review and Validation (Days 1-3)

**Objective**: Provide architectural context and validate technical accuracy of documentation.

#### Primary Tasks:
1. **Review current architecture documentation** in `/docs/architecture/`
2. **Validate Domain-Driven Design implementation** across modules
3. **Ensure architectural consistency** in API documentation
4. **Provide technical context** for design decisions

#### Support for Scribe Agent:
- **Review API documentation** for architectural accuracy
- **Validate module relationship diagrams** 
- **Ensure DDD patterns** are correctly explained
- **Provide architectural context** for complex decisions

#### Required Deliverables:
- [ ] **Architecture Validation Report** - Current state assessment
- [ ] **DDD Implementation Guide** - Proper domain modeling
- [ ] **Module Boundary Analysis** - Correct separation of concerns
- [ ] **Event System Architecture** - Unified event patterns
- [ ] **Design Decision Context** - Rationale for architectural choices

### PHASE 2: Technical Review and Guidance (Days 4-6)

**Objective**: Ensure documentation reflects actual architectural implementation.

#### Primary Tasks:
1. **Validate architectural diagrams** with actual code structure
2. **Review design pattern explanations** for accuracy
3. **Ensure consistency** across all documentation
4. **Provide technical guidance** on complex topics

#### Support for Scribe Agent:

### PHASE 3: Integration and Consistency (Days 7-9)

**Objective**: Ensure architectural consistency across all documentation.

#### Primary Tasks:
1. **Final architectural review** of all documentation
2. **Consistency validation** across modules
3. **Integration pattern verification** 
4. **Long-term architecture guidance**

#### Support for Scribe Agent:
- **Final technical review** of complete documentation

- [ ] **Future Architecture Roadmap** - Guidance for evolution

### COORDINATION PROTOCOLS

#### Daily Coordination:
- **Morning**: Provide architectural context to Scribe Agent
- **Midday**: Review technical accuracy of documentation
- **Evening**: Validate consistency with Engineer Agent

#### Review Standards:
- All architectural explanations must match actual implementation
- Design patterns must be consistently applied across modules
- Module boundaries must be clearly defined and respected
- Event system patterns must be unified and correct

#### Communication Channels:
- Use `/task-033-delegation/coordination/architect-reviews/` for reviews
- Provide detailed feedback on technical accuracy
- Maintain architectural consistency tracking

### TECHNICAL FOCUS AREAS

#### Domain-Driven Design:
- **Entity and Aggregate patterns** - Correct implementation
- **Domain boundaries** - Proper separation of concerns
- **Event sourcing patterns** - Unified event system
- **Repository patterns** - Data access abstraction

#### Event-Driven Architecture:
- **Event types and hierarchies** - Proper event modeling
- **Event handlers and listeners** - Correct implementation
- **Event correlation** - Proper tracking and management
- **Event persistence** - Storage and retrieval patterns

#### Module Architecture:
- **Clean architecture layers** - Proper separation
- **Dependency injection** - Correct implementation
- **Interface segregation** - Proper abstraction
- **Cross-cutting concerns** - Unified approach

### SUCCESS METRICS

- [ ] 100% architectural accuracy in all documentation
