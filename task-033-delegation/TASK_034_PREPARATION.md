### 3. Enforcement Strategy
**Design automated enforcement approach**:
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Code review automation
- Quality metrics tracking
- Violation reporting and resolution

### 4. Integration with Task 033
**Coordinate with documentation team**:
- Ensure coding standards are documented
- Integrate with contributing guidelines
