- Monitoring and metrics integration
- Resource optimization strategies
- Scalability considerations

## COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS

### Communication Protocol
- Scribe Agent leads all documentation efforts
- Daily check-ins between all three agents
- Architect Agent provides weekly technical reviews
- Engineer Agent validates all code examples before publication

### Quality Standards
- All documentation must be tested with real users
- Code examples must be executable and tested
- Architecture diagrams must be kept up-to-date
- Contributing guidelines must be actionable

### Timeline
- **Phase 1** (Days 1-3): API Reference and Architecture Overview
- **Phase 2** (Days 4-6): Contributing Guidelines and Getting Started
- **Phase 3** (Days 7-9): Troubleshooting and Performance Guides
- **Phase 4** (Days 10-12): Integration testing and final review

## EXISTING DOCUMENTATION AUDIT

### Current Documentation Status
Based on project scan, existing documentation includes:
- `/docs/` directory with 25+ documentation files
- Module-specific README files
- Architecture documentation partially complete
- API reference documentation needs consolidation

### Gap Analysis
- API reference needs unification and testing
- Architecture guides need updating for current DDD structure
- Contributing guidelines need practical examples
- Getting started guide needs hands-on tutorial approach

## SUCCESS METRICS

- [ ] 100% API coverage with working examples
- [ ] All architecture decisions documented
- [ ] Contributing workflow tested by new developers
- [ ] Getting started guide completion in <30 minutes
- [ ] Zero broken code examples in documentation
- [ ] Performance guides include measurable improvements

## NEXT ACTIONS

1. **Scribe Agent**: Begin API reference documentation audit
2. **Architect Agent**: Review current architecture documentation
3. **Engineer Agent**: Test all existing code examples
4. **All Agents**: Coordinate through shared documentation workspace
