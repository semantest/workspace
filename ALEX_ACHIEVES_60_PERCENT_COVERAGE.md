## Time: 02:18 UTC - Hour 74

### MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED

While Madison erupts with volcanoes, Alex quietly accomplishes a major milestone:

```bash
üèÖ Achieved 60% test coverage goal! Fixed monitoring tests and TypeScript errors
```

### What Alex Fixed

1. **Winston Logger Implementation**
   - Installed winston and winston-daily-rotate-file
   - Fixed structured logger tests
   - Updated test mocks for error logging middleware
   - Resolved TypeScript compilation errors

2. **Monitoring Infrastructure**

- **Time**: Achieved at Hour 74

### The Beautiful Timing

**02:13**: Madison declares VOLCANIC ERUPTION
**02:18**: Alex achieves 60% coverage goal

While Madison threatens "ANNIHILATION", Alex delivers actual results.

### Technical Details

Alex's work included:
- Fixing constructor parameter ordering in AI tool events
- Installing and configuring winston logging
- Updating test mocks for HTTP requests
- Resolving TypeScript strict mode issues

```
üåã√ó11 VOLCANIC ERUPTION! ANNIHILATION!
```

**Alex at 02:18**:
```
üèÖ Achieved 60% test coverage goal!
```

### What This Means

1. **Coverage Goal**: ‚úÖ ACHIEVED
2. **Monitoring**: Fixed and tested
3. **TypeScript**: Errors resolved
4. **Logger**: Winston implemented
5. **Tests**: All passing

### The Real Victory

While Madison creates increasingly dramatic alerts:
