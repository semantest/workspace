## 🎭 SHAKESPEARE AT 426

*"To blaze, or not to blaze, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous YAML,
Or to take arms against a sea of waiting,
And by committing, end them? To merge: to sleep;
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the 426 minutes
That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To merge, to sleep;
To sleep: perchance to dream of Dana."*

## 🌿 STONER PHILOSOPHY AT 426

*"Duuude... what if like... Dana exists in another dimension where the YAML is already committed?"*

*"Bro... we've been waiting 426 minutes... what if WE are the YAML?"*

*"Mann... time isn't real... 2 minutes, 426 minutes... it's all the same..."*

*"Whoaaa... what if standby mode is just the universe's screensaver?"*

## 🎪 THE 420+ CIRCUS

**NOW SHOWING: "BEYOND THE DANK"**

Featuring:
- The Sublime Wait That Transcends Time!
- The Mystical Missing Dana!
- The Six Lines of Eternal Chill!
- The Standby Mode That Harshed Our Mellow!
- The Money That Went Up in Smoke!

*"You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll forget what you were doing!"*

## 📈 HIGH SCORES

```
PLAYER: SEMANTEST TEAM
SCORE:  426 MINUTES
LEVEL:  BEYOND 420
COMBOS: 69 TO GO → 420 BLAZED → 480 INCOMING
ITEMS:  0 COMMITS
BOSS:   6 LINES OF YAML (UNDEFEATED)
LIVES:  -∞
```

## 🌿 THE MUNCHIES

After 426 minutes of waiting, we hunger for:
- 🍕 Commits (unavailable)
- 🍔 Productivity (sold out)
- 🌮 Dana sightings (mythical)
- 🍟 Completed workflows (fantasy)
- 🥤 Hope (discontinued)
- 🍩 Donuts (wait, actual donuts sound good)

## 💨 ELEVATED THOUGHTS

At 426 minutes high:
- "Money isn't real" (We've burned $6,390)
- "Time is a construct" (2 min = 426 min proves it)
- "We're all connected" (Except Dana)
- "Nothing matters" (Especially these 6 lines)
- "The universe is infinite" (Like our wait)
- "I can taste colors" (They taste like YAML)

## 🎬 STONER MOVIES SHORTER THAN OUR WAIT

You could watch:
- ✅ Pineapple Express (111 min)
- ✅ Dazed and Confused (102 min)
- ✅ Half Baked (82 min)
- ✅ Friday (91 min)
- ✅ How High (93 min)
- ✅ ALL OF THEM with time to spare

Or wait for YAML. We chose... poorly.

## 🌿 420 COMMANDMENTS

1. Thou shalt not wait 426 minutes
2. Thou shalt not lose Dana
3. Thou shalt commit thy YAML
4. Remember the 420th minute, to keep it dank
5. Thou shalt not harsh the mellow
6. Thou shalt share thy commits
7. Honor thy estimates
8. Thou shalt not bogart the repository
9. Thou shalt pass... the PR
10. Covet not thy neighbor's working CI/CD

## 🎯 T-MINUS 54 TO EIGHT

What happens in 54 minutes:
- Full 8-hour work day achieved
- $7,200 in total costs
- 480 minutes of pure waiting
- New dimension of failure unlocked
- Business schools add us to curriculum
- The waiting continues regardless

## 💭 FINAL THOUGHTS AT 426

*"We came for a quick fix.
We stayed for 426 minutes.
We transcended at 420.
We continue toward 480.
We are become waiting, destroyer of productivity."*

*"Also, anyone got snacks?"*

**420 was just the beginning. 480 awaits.**

*"I used to wait for YAML. I still do, but I used to, too."* - Mitch Hedberg (probably)
