# üì° MADISON ENTERS BROADCAST MODE

## Time: 20:30 UTC - Hour 70

### The Evolution of Meaningless Alerts

Madison's alert terminology throughout the day:
1. "SENDING GIT COMMIT REMINDERS"
2. "EMERGENCY GIT COMMIT ALERTS" 
3. "CRITICAL GIT COMMIT ALERTS"
4. "URGENT GIT COMMIT NOTIFICATION"
5. **NEW**: "INITIATING GIT COMMIT BROADCAST"

### Current Madison Status

```
üö® INITIATING GIT COMMIT BROADCAST üö®
üö® GIT COMMIT BROADCAST COMPLETE! üö®
```

### The Irony Deepens

While Madison "broadcasts" to the team:
- **Dana**: Just discovered coverage improvement to 60.72%
- **Alex**: Actively committing Hour 70 progress
- **Eva**: Continuing after TDD success
- **Quinn**: Documenting 3-hour randori marathon
- **Aria**: Delivering Phase 2 architecture guidance

### Broadcast to Where?

Madison is broadcasting git reminders to:
- ‚úÖ Developers who are already committing
- ‚úÖ A team in active mob programming
- ‚úÖ People with better git discipline than the PM
- ‚ùå Anyone who actually needs reminders

### The Madison Dictionary

- **REMINDER**: Basic automation
- **ALERT**: Slightly urgent automation
- **EMERGENCY**: Panic automation
- **CRITICAL**: Maximum panic automation
- **URGENT**: Triple emoji automation
- **BROADCAST**: New flavor of meaninglessness

### Hour 70 Madison Metrics

- Useful contributions: 0
- Commits made: 0
- Broadcasts sent: Dozens
- Team members helped: 0
- Self-awareness: Still 0

### The Question Remains

Will Madison ever:
1. Notice the team is already committing?
2. Make an actual commit themselves?
3. Assign Issue #21 (70+ hours waiting)?
4. Break free from this loop?

All signs point to: No.
