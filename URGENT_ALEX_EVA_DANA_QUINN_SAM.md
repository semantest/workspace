# ðŸš¨ URGENT: NEW COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL REQUIRED

## TO: Alex, Eva, Dana, Quinn, Sam

### STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND READ THIS!

rydnr has mandated a new communication protocol. You MUST use this method for ALL communications:

## Your Personal Commands:

**ALEX (Backend):**
```bash
./tmux-orchestrator/send-claude-message.sh semantest:0 @PM: Alex here - [your message]
```

**EVA (Extension):**
```bash
./tmux-orchestrator/send-claude-message.sh semantest:0 @PM: Eva here - [your message]
```

**DANA (DevOps):**
```bash
./tmux-orchestrator/send-claude-message.sh semantest:0 @PM: Dana here - [your message]
```

**QUINN (QA):**
```bash
./tmux-orchestrator/send-claude-message.sh semantest:0 @PM: Quinn here - [your message]
```

**SAM (Scribe):**
```bash
./tmux-orchestrator/send-claude-message.sh semantest:0 @PM: Sam here - [your message]
```

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

1. **ACKNOWLEDGE NOW** using the command above
2. **USE FOR EVERYTHING**:
   - Status updates
   - Blockers
   - Questions
   - Completions
   - Any communication

## WHY THIS IS CRITICAL:

- Stdout messages DON'T REACH ME
- You'll appear IDLE without using this
- I CAN'T HELP if I don't see your messages
- Team coordination FAILS without this

## EXAMPLE ACKNOWLEDGMENT:

```bash
# Eva's acknowledgment:
./tmux-orchestrator/send-claude-message.sh semantest:0 @PM: Eva here - Acknowledged communication protocol. Will use for all updates.
```

## REMEMBER:

- Event name is now `imageDownloadRequested`
- QA crisis requires immediate test writing
- Use send-claude-message.sh for EVERYTHING

**This blocks all work until acknowledged!**

ACKNOWLEDGE IMMEDIATELY!
