# üö® URGENT FIX FOR RYDNR - 500 STRIPS BLOCKED!

## THE PROBLEM:
You're loading from `/extension.chrome/build/` which has an OLD manifest!

## THE SOLUTION - DO THIS NOW:

### Option 1: CORRECT LOADING PATH (FASTEST)
```bash
# Load from the PARENT directory:
/home/chous/work/semantest/extension.chrome/
```
NOT from `/extension.chrome/build/`!

### Option 2: If you MUST load from build/
Let me fix the manifest version:

```bash
cd /home/chous/work/semantest/extension.chrome/build/
# Edit manifest.json and change:
# "version": "1.0.0-beta"  ‚Üê If this exists
# TO:
# "version": "1.0.0"
```

## WHY THIS HAPPENED:
- Main extension uses `/extension.chrome/manifest.json` (version 1.0.1)
- Build folder has OLD manifest with different version
- You should load the PARENT, not build!

## IMMEDIATE ACTION FOR 500 STRIPS:

1. Close Chrome extension page
2. Open `chrome://extensions/` again
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Navigate to: `/home/chous/work/semantest/extension.chrome/`
5. Select that folder (NOT /build/)
6. Extension loads successfully!

## TEST YOUR GRAPHIC NOVEL:
```bash
./generate-image.sh "Panel 1: The hero awakens"
```

**rydnr - Your 500 strips are ONE correct path away!**
