# DevOps Engineer Status Report

**Date**: $(date)
**Engineer**: DevOps Agent
**Session**: tmux 'devops'

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Docker Containers for WebSocket Server
- Created multi-stage Dockerfile for SDK WebSocket server
- Optimized for production with security best practices
- Non-root user, health checks, proper signal handling
- Location: `/sdk/server/Dockerfile`

### 2. Docker Compose Setup for Local Development  
- Comprehensive docker-compose.yml with all services
- Includes: WebSocket server, Redis, PostgreSQL (optional), monitoring stack
- Development-friendly with volume mounts and debug settings
- Profiles for different components (monitoring, tracing, tools)
- Location: `/docker-compose.yml`

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline for Automated Testing
- GitHub Actions workflow for WebSocket server
- Multi-stage pipeline: lint ‚Üí test ‚Üí build ‚Üí deploy
- Matrix testing across Node.js versions (16, 18, 20)
- Security scanning with Trivy
- Automated Docker image building and pushing
- Location: `/.github/workflows/websocket-server-ci.yml`

### 4. Monitoring and Logging Infrastructure
- Prometheus configuration for metrics collection
- Grafana setup with datasources
- Health check and metrics endpoints configured
- Optional ELK stack for logging (in docker-compose)
- Distributed tracing with Jaeger
- Locations: `/monitoring/`

### 5. Deployment Scripts for Various Environments
- General deployment script with rollback capability
- Production-specific script with safety checks
- Blue-green deployment support
- Smoke tests for post-deployment validation
- Environment-specific configuration files
- Locations: `/deploy/scripts/`, `/deploy/env/`

### 6. Infrastructure as Code Templates
- Complete Kubernetes manifests using Kustomize
- Base resources: Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, PVC, Ingress
- High availability features: HPA, PDB
- Environment overlays: development, staging, production
- Proper resource limits and security configurations
- Location: `/deploy/k8s/`

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

**IMPORTANT**: Coordinating with Security Engineer - The following security measures are implemented but await security review:

1. **Container Security**:
   - Non-root user execution
   - Minimal base images (Alpine)
   - No unnecessary packages

2. **Secrets Management**:
   - Kubernetes secrets for sensitive data
   - Environment-specific secret files (not committed)
   - Example files provided for reference

3. **Network Security**:
   - TLS/SSL configuration in Ingress
   - CORS configuration per environment
   - Rate limiting enabled

4. **Access Control**:
   - JWT authentication ready (awaiting security config)
   - RBAC templates ready for Kubernetes

## üö¶ Next Steps

1. **Security Review Required**:
   - WebSocket authentication implementation
   - Certificate management setup
   - Network policies configuration
   - Secret rotation strategy

2. **Production Readiness**:
   - Load testing at scale
   - Disaster recovery procedures
   - Backup and restore automation
   - Multi-region deployment strategy

3. **Observability Enhancement**:
   - Custom Grafana dashboards
   - Alert rules configuration
   - Log aggregation pipeline
   - APM integration

## üìã Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Local Development
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f websocket-server

# Kubernetes Deployment
kubectl apply -k deploy/k8s/overlays/development
./deploy/scripts/deploy.sh staging v1.0.0

# Health Check
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Smoke Tests
./deploy/tests/smoke-test.sh development
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **DO NOT DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION** until security issues are resolved
2. All secrets in examples are development defaults - must be changed
3. Monitoring stack is optional but recommended for production
4. Review and adjust resource limits based on actual usage

## üìÅ Deliverables

- `/sdk/server/Dockerfile` - WebSocket server container
- `/cli/Dockerfile` - CLI tool container
- `/docker-compose.yml` - Local development environment
- `/.github/workflows/websocket-server-ci.yml` - CI/CD pipeline
- `/deploy/` - Complete deployment toolkit
- `/monitoring/` - Observability configuration

**Status**: All DevOps tasks completed. Awaiting security clearance for production deployment.
