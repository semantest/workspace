# Current Status Update - 16:41:05

## Situation Clarification

### What Happened Previously
- Built ChatGPT browser extension v1.0.1 (completed)
- Discovered user actually wanted distributed testing framework
- User confirmed hybrid architecture approach

### Current Work (Per Architecture Decision)
Priority order confirmed by user:
1. ✅ **CLI Tool** - COMPLETED (just now)
2. 🔄 **SDK Libraries** - Next priority
3. ⏳ **Generic Extension + Plugin System**
4. ⏳ **Website Contracts**
5. ⏳ **D-Bus Integration (Linux only)**

### What We Just Built
```

├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── README.md
└── src/
    ├── index.ts (main CLI entry)

    │   ├── config.ts
    │   └── status.ts
    └── utils/
        └── params.ts
```

### Next Steps
- Create SDK for type-safe domain events
- Design event contract system
- Implement WebSocket server
- Transform browser extension to generic with plugin system

### Git Status
- Branch: feature/012-module-structure-design
- 17 commits ahead of origin
- New CLI implementation ready to commit

## No Active "Team Agents"
The previous 9-agent team simulation concluded when we discovered the architecture mismatch. Current work is being done directly based on user's architecture decisions.
