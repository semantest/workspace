## Your Story

Every person who reads these stories is writing their own story with testing. Some are still in the frustration phase, wrestling with brittle selectors and maintenance nightmares. Others are in the discovery phase, just learning that there might be a better way.

The question these stories ask is simple: **What chapter are you in?**

- **Chapter 1**: The frustration (we've all been here)
- **Chapter 2**: The discovery (you're probably here now)  
- **Chapter 3**: The experiment (ready to try something new?)
- **Chapter 4**: The transformation (where the magic happens)
- **Chapter 5**: The advocacy (sharing your success with others)
